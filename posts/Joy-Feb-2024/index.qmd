## Thursday: Travel day – flying to Miami

Becky and I flew to Miami to catch a seven day Caribbean cruise on the Norwegian Joy. The cruise is a round trip from Miami, and we will stop at four ports: Roatán in Honduras, Harvest Caye (NCL’s private island) in Belize, Costa Maya in Mexico and Cozumel in Mexico. Along the way we will have two sea days.

Our trip started with an early morning drive to Van Nuys to catch the Flyaway bus to LAX to catch a 6:15am departure to Miami on American Airlines. 

We got up at 1am and left the house at 2:10am. There was no traffic along the way, but there was a bit of fog. We made it to the bus terminal by 3am and by 3:30am we were on the bus headed to LAX. By 4:30am we had our bags checked, made it through security and sitting at the gate with about one hour until boarding. 

Our flight to Miami lasted about 5 hours. We departed at sunrise and flew east over Los Angeles and Arizona. At some point there were too many clouds below us to see the land.

We were served pre-takeoff beverages, I had a coffee with Baileys and Becky had orange juice with vodka. We were served omelets for breakfast. I started the second chapter of “How the Irish Saved Civilization”, which I’m finding very interesting.

After collecting our bags, which took about 30 minutes, we went outside to the hotel shuttle pick-up spot. The temperature outside was in the low 70’s. When we got on the van there were two guys sitting in the front of the van, which seemed a bit unusual when I thought about it later. We were waiting at door number three, so I told Becky that we still have to pick up at the other terminals so the van might get crowded. We made it almost to the last terminal before stopping where the two guys got out. So Becky and I moved up to the first row in the van, since a big group of people were getting on. That way she could get off the bus first and get us checked in, or so we thought. It took a while to get everyone's bags loaded and for them to all get aboard. Then the two guys who had been in the van when we boarded got back on. 

I said to one of them, ‘sorry, we took your seats, I didn’t know you were coming back.’ 

He said, ‘no worries, we had to return a bag and thought we would be catching the next van’.  Then he proceeded to explain that he had picked up someone else’s bag and got a call from the airline asking if they had the wrong bag, which they did, and that’s why they were back at the airport.

At the hotel, the desk clerk would not let Becky check us in since the reservation was in my name. Becky said, “But he’s right outside collecting our bags.” 

“I need to see him face to face”, was his answer. 

By then, the large group was lining up behind Becky when I showed up and we proceeded with the check-in. The leader of the large group, and we could tell they all knew each other by the conversations in the van, was informed that he was at the wrong hotel. We never asked the driver which address he was going to and just assumed we were going to ‘our’ hotel. Lucky for us, we were in the right van. Becky had gotten the instructions and was told to just get on the red Town Place hotel van, like there would only be theirs that pick up at the Miami airport.

Dinner was Cuban sandwiches from a nearby Cuban restaurant, which was about a five minute walk. They were good but a little too much bread and meat.

As we pulled away from the gate, the flight attendant came by to collect the cups and told those who had not finished their drinks to hold them in their hands for take off. ](IMG_20240222_061438508_HDR.jpg)
