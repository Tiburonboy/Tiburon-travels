    "text": "Today we are in Juneau and the weather is rainy and 50F. The rain is forecasted to last all day long. There are five cruise ships in port - Celebrity Solstice (2,852 double occupancy), Grand Princess (2,600 double occupancy), Noordam (1,924 double occupancy), Norwegian Jade (2,402 double occupancy) and the Oceania Riviera. It is also a tender port for the Riviera. On account of the gloomy weather Becky and I are staying on board today.\n\n\n\nA rainy day in Juneau.\n\n\nAfter breakfast we participated in the regularly scheduled activities, bocce ball, bean bag toss, etc. There are usually two activities scheduled in the morning, one at 930am and the other at 1030am, there are two more activities in the afternoon. We have skipped trivia on this cruise. So far we have collected about 100 Big-O points. Attending these activities also gives us a chance to socialize with the other passengers. One of the passengers gave us a bottle of wine, which was much appreciated since we don’t have the drink package on this cruise. Since the bottle was provided by the ship we don’t have to pay the corkage fee if we bring the wine to dinner.\nWe had dinner in the main dining room tonight. Becky had braised leg of lamb. She said it was OK, but she would not get it again. So today, she had lamb chops for breakfast, lamb stew with rice for lunch and lamb again for dinner. I think she likes lamb. I had a bite of the braised lamb from her dinner because she said it tasted like beef, but I thought it was lammy and didn’t taste at all like beef. I had the Alaska Salmon, which was listed as the chef’s signature dish. It was good, but nothing spectacular.\n\n\n\nBraised lamb.\n\n\n\n\n\nAlaskan Salmon.\n\n\nWe attended two musical performances tonight. The first one, called Jukebox Hero, was very good. The evening show in the theater was called Motor City Moved, which was a mashup of Motown hits choreographed with dancers and singers. We had a hard time staying awake during this one. For some reason, we are always sleepy during these 915pm shows."

    "text": "It’s been three and a half weeks since we returned home from Mexico. Our tans have not yet had a chance to fade and here we go again. Today we are embarking on the Oceania Regatta for a seven day cruise with stops in Santa Barbara, San Francisco and Ensenada Mexico. We are back to our routine of going somewhere about every month.\nIt was a year ago when we cruised on the Regatta. The itinerary is similar; this time with a stop in Santa Barbara in place of Catalina Island. Oceania advertises itself as having the “Finest Cuisine at Sea”. We thought the food was good on Oceania, but not really the finest; food is very subjective. Holland and NCL have good food and Oceania was not head and shoulders above them. I suppose what makes Oceania unique is that there is no up-charge for any of the food items. For example, the coffee shop on the Regatta, called Baristas, which serves specialty coffees, teas, pastries and finger foods, are all included in the cruise fare. Oceania offers grilled Lobster tail, grilled Lamb chops and Gelato in the buffet with no additional charge. I think my trip reports will be primarily about food and the daily activities. As far as the food goes, on this cruise, I’m planning to try different menu items from those I had last time on the Regatta.\nSince our last cruise on Oceania, there is a new program called, “Simply More”, where a shore excursion credit and wine and beer, served by the glass, during lunch and dinner are included in the cruise fare. There is no opting out, so we are being forced to take shore excursions and drink wine or beer. Such a hardship! I’m not complaining about the wine and beer, but the included shore excursions are not that great. More on that later in the week when we take the excursions that Becky and I selected.\nThis cruise is advertised as, “West Coast Vines - Round Trip Los Angeles”. The cruise line offers some wine related excursions in Santa Barbara and Ensenada. We scheduled an excursion in Ensenada to a winery that also includes lunch.\n\n\n\nAbout a month before embarkation, we received four luggage tags and a cruise itinerary book from Oceania. A year ago, the book was personalized with our names printed in various places in the book. This year, the book is just a generic printing that describes the itinerary and the amenities offered by Oceania on this cruise.\n\n\nThe luggage tags are nice and can be used for any trip. We received a sheet of printed inserts for the luggage tags with our names and cabin number.\nAs soon as the specialty restaurant reservation window opened, about three months prior to sailing, Becky booked dining at the steak house and Italian restaurant. We wanted early seating and a two top table. We have no interest in sharing a table with strangers. The upper categories of cabins have early booking for restaurant reservations, so we were able to secure the times we wanted. Cabins below the concierge category are the last group to book (about 70% of the ship). Those passengers will be sharing tables and have late dining times. The specialty restaurants are simply too small to accommodate everyone’s preferences.\nThis is our second Oceania cruise, and as repeat Oceania cruisers, we can attend the captain’s party, a second chance to order free drinks. The beverage package is an additional $50 per person per day and includes most alcoholic beverages, which we did not purchase. We can bring our own wine and spirits on board for consumption in our room, and mixers are free and delivered by the butler, so drinking in the bar is not what we plan to do on this cruise. We have $100 of ship credit, so we might order a few drinks during happy hour. I’m bringing a Nalgene bottle with a 1:1 mix of vodka and gin to make gin and tonics. I like to dilute my gin with some vodka. Becky brings Crown Royal to mix with Sprite along with a bottle of Pinot Grigio. We received a bottle of champagne and a bottle of red wine to enjoy in our room, a bowl of fruit and a vase of fresh flowers.\nThis morning I woke at 6am, made a cup of coffee and started the final packing. Most of my things were already in the suitcase, all that remained were last minute items. Breakfast was a fried egg and half of a chicken sausage. Becky made herself a fried egg sandwich.\nThe drive to the cruise port in San Pedro is 81 miles from Ventura and took about two hours. We ran into lots of typical weekday morning traffic and there was one crash that caused a 15 minute delay. As we passed the crash, there were about ten cars pulled off to the side of the freeway. Only one of the cars was badly damaged. We arrived at the cruise terminal around 1045am. The company that runs the parking lot has installed new gates at the entrance and it took me a minute to figure out how to work them. Now you have to tap your credit card before you can pull a ticket. The parking lot was surprisingly empty and we drove around a bit to find a good parking spot near the luggage drop off. The Crown Princess was also in port.\nAfter dropping off our one checked bag we had to wait about 2 minutes before the attendants started calling for cabins. They called for owners’ suites first, but no one got up, so a minute later the PH category was called and about 20 people got up to get in line for the check in counter. Oceania runs their checkin different than the other cruise lines, there is no unnecessary standing in lines. A few minutes later we had our key cards and were on the ship. The first thing we had to do was check in at our muster station to get our key cards scanned. Then we went to find lunch.\n\n\n\nCruise itinerary map. On this cruise the ports are Santa Barbara, 2 days in San Francisco and Ensenada, Mexico, is the obligatory foreign port."

We knew from last time that we would not be able to drop off our carry-on bags at our cabin. We decided to have lunch at Waves Grill which is adjacent to the pool and we were seated by 1120 am. The Grill opened at 1130am, so we only had a few minutes to wait. Becky ordered a shrimp roll, a glass of chardonnay and for dessert she got some cookies from the buffet. I ordered a fish burrito, beer and later I had a milkshake.\n\n\n\nDrinking a Peroni Beer.\n\n\n\n\n\nShrimp roll (baby shrimp, cocktail salad, toasted bun), grilled pieces lobster on the side, wine\n\n\n\n\n\nMahi Mahi Burrito (black beans, rice, guacamole, cheddar, tomato salsa, tortilla)\n\n\nShortly after lunch our cabin was ready and our checked bag was waiting outside our cabin door. Our butler stopped by to greet us and give us instructions about ordering room service, restocking the mini fridge etc. His name is Covin and he is from India. We told him that we would like cans of Tonic water and Sprite. Later he stopped by again and delivered about four cans of Tonic water and Sprite and took away the cans of Coke and diet Coke. He also dropped off a bottle of red wine from our travel agent.\n\n\n\nOur travel agent provided an arrangement of flowers for the room.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter unpacking and organizing our stuff we drank some of the champagne and ate the treats that were delivered to the room. The champagne was okay, I’m not a fan of champaign.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon we picked up two of the Art Scavenger Hunt sheets and started roaming around the ship to locate the items.

    "text": "Embarkation, part 3\nWe did not have any reservations for dinner, so we tried to secure a walk-in spot at one of the specialty restaurants. Becky had read that this is sometimes possible on the first day. The Italian restaurant Toscana had an opening and we got a two topper by the window.\n\n\n\nDinner is served with a bread basket and a clove of roasted garlic. Our waiter came by our table with a cart of olive oils and balsamic vinegars that can be poured into a small bowl for dipping the bread in. Since we didn’t have any clue about the various types of olive oil or balsamic vinegar, we went with his suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\nOlive oil and balsamic vinegar cart.\n\n\nFirst course: both were good. Becky ordered her shrimp scampi without the pepper flakes.\n\n\n\nCode Di Scampi – sauteed jumbo shrimp, cherry tomato sauce\n\n\n\n\n\nInvoltini Di Melanzane – eggplant rolls, prague ham and smoked scamorza stuffing, tomato sauce, parmesan. These were really good. The egg plant was sliced very thin and fried.\n\n\nSecond course: Becky only wanted the tagliolini carbonara. The other pastas were good. I don’t remember the name of Chef’s Pasta Special, but it was spicy with a hint of bacon.\n\n\n\nTrio Toscana – tagliolini carbonara, risotto allaragosta, gnocchi al pesto\n\n\n\n\n\nChef’s Pasta Special\n\n\nMain course: Both were good, but Becky only ate half of the lobster, so I gave her some of the dover sole and I ate the rest of her lobster. The dover sole was really good and the sauce was nice.\n\n\n\nAragosta Fra Diavolo – maine lobster, tagliolini, garlic, chili peppers, italian parsely, tomato sauce.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur waiter is removing the bones and plating the fish. The fish and sauce was very good.\n\n\n\n\n\nSogliola Alla Mugnaia – sauteed dover sole, steamed potatoes, lemon-parsley brown butter emulsion.\n\n\nDessert: Becky liked her chestnut cream cappuccino. I only ate about half of the apricot tart, just too many apricots for my tastes.\n\n\n\nChestnut cream cappuccino, meringue, white chocolate foam\n\n\n\n\n\nCrispy apricot tart, pistachio cream.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe show tonight was called “Broadway in Concert”.

    "text": "Santa Barbara, Friday, September 27, 2024\nThis morning when we woke, the Regatta was stationed about one mile off shore from the city of Santa Barbara. Kind of weird that our first port is only about 30 miles from home. The weather today was overcast most of the day with a high around 70F and light winds. After my morning shower, I took my laptop to Horizon lounge to do some work and drink coffee. About an hour later I joined Becky for another coffee and breakfast.\n\n\n\nSelf Service coffee station in Horizon lounge, opens at 630am. I usually order an americano and I think these machines make the best coffee on the ship.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaristas is the coffee shop just outside the main dining room. I usually order an americano here, but the flavor is a bit bitter. Becky likes to get the flavored lattes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf service morning snacks next to the coffee bar. I usually don’t have any of these. Becky likes the almond pastries.\n\n\nFor breakfast, I had the special of the day which was huevos rancheros. Becky had an omelet with two lamb chops. After breakfast we tried our skills at the golf putting challenge and the bean bag toss. Then we took the tender to town.\nI can’t remember the last time that we went to Santa Barbara, maybe 15 years ago. We drive through on the freeway about twice a year. The tender to the marina took about 15 minutes to go from ship to shore in one of the ship’s lifeboats. We had planned to visit a brewery and I looked up the opening times before we left. When we got there it was closed and didn’t look like it would open before noon. So we walked along State Street a bit to REI and went in to have a look at the clothes and camping equipment. Back onboard we went to the spa to soak in the big hot tub. Today we skipped lunch.\n\n\n\nWe attended afternoon tea. Oceania puts on a nice tea at 4pm almost every day.\n\n\nCanapes are delivered almost every day. We can choose from a variety of options, which we select on a small order sheet that we place on our door in the morning.\n\n\n\nCalifornia rolls (vegetable maki, ginger pickles, wasabi and tamari sauce)\n\n\n\n\n\nBouquet of crudites (assortment of vegetables sticks with plant based mayo dip)\n\n\nDinner tonight was at a specialty restaurant called Polo Grill, which is a steakhouse.\n\n\n\nApple Cider Marinated, Slow-Roasted Pork Belly with Honey Soy Sauce – this was OK, but not the best I’ve had.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoasted Beetroot and Garlic Goat Cheese, Napoleon with Champagne and Truffle Vinaigrette – Becky liked this.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthwestern Navy Bean Soup with Pepper Purée, Spanish Chorizo and Sourdough Croutons – very good\n\n\n\n\n\nRibeye (12 oz) – Too big, I only ate half of it.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrilled Colorado Rack of Lamb (12 oz) – Becky liked her lamb, but she had to send one back to the kitchen because it was too rare.\n\n\nWe ordered various side dishes: Lobster Mac & Cheese, Potatoes Au Gratin, Crispy Onion Rings and Haricots Verts Amandine (green beans)\nI chose the Crème Brûlée for dessert. This was OK, not the best I’ve had, I would order it again. None of the other selections sounded good. My second choice would have been ice cream.\n\n\n\nCrème Brûlée\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky’s dessert choice: Chocolate Fudge Brownie with Raspberry Sauce and Tahitian Vanilla Bean Ice Cream\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the flowers that normally are in each room and they were delivered in the afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Starlink satellite antennas are a new addition to the ship. These are the 12 square flat things mounted on the poles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe basic internet included with the cruise fare. The internet speed is very slow: 1.4 MB down and 2.5 MB up, which is slightly better than no internet. Pictures take awhile to upload."

    "text": "San Francisco, Sunday, September 29, 2024\nAt 630am I went up to the Horizon Lounge to have my usual morning coffee and about 50 people were there waiting for the ship to sail under the Golden Gate Bridge. As we sailed under the bridge, it was too dark to take pictures.\n\n\n\nThe weather this morning was cloudy and cold.\n\n\nWe had breakfast in the Grand Dining Room. Becky had an omelet and steak. She gave me half of the steak. The steak was not that tender, but had a nice flavor. Becky thought she needed extra calories for our walk today. I ordered scrambled eggs, hash browns and Canadian bacon. After breakfast we played golf.\nAround 10am we left the ship for our walk in the city. The plan for the day was to visit the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. The walk was about 1 mile in each direction. The theme for the park is maritime history. The Park includes several historic ships, only the Balcultha was open for self guided tours. Balclutha was a cargo ship, one of thousands of iron and steel sailing vessels built in Great Britain and Europe beginning in the 1860s. During thirteen years under the British flag, Balclutha called at San Francisco five times, bringing coal and general cargo from Europe and returning with California grain. From 1903 to 1930 the ship made yearly voyages between San Francisco and Alaska. Renamed Star of Alaska, she sailed for the Alaska Packers Association, carrying men and supplies to the canneries and bringing back packed salmon.\n\n\n\nThe Balclutha\n\n\n\n\n\nGalley\n\n\n\n\n\nMain deck\n\n\nWe were back onboard in time for lunch. Only the buffet and Waves Grill were open and we decided to eat at Waves Grill, where we could sit down and order off the menu. I had a beer and the Cuban Sandwich and Becky had the Ribs, which was only one rib.\n\n\n\nSlow roasted pork ribs (barbecue sauce, coleslaw) Becky didn’t like the ribs, the meat was too tough and didn’t fall off the bone.\n\n\n\n\n\nOceania Cuban (slow-roasted marinated pork, ham, swiss, dill pickles, mustard, grilled cuban bread, mariquita chips, cuban mojo sauce). A year ago, I thought the Cuban was delicious and during that cruise, I had three of them. This time, I didn’t think they were as good as I remembered.\n\n\nIn the afternoon, I worked on the Art Scavenger Hunt. We have met several people who are also looking for art and we compare and share answers. This is a good way to meet people. While wandering around the ship, I noticed that about ten tables in the main dining room were set up for a birthday dinner. Becky has read many of the posts on Cruise Critic made by the birthday girl. She is very well connected in the travel industry and we figured she was a travel agent. We didn’t know what birthday she was celebrating, but she did say online that it was a special birthday. From the table decorations we learned that she is 90 years old. We saw her around the ship and we were guessing her age was 70.\n\n\n\nBirthday party table.\n\n\nAbout a week after returning home, Becky read on Cruise Critic that the birthday girl had passed away. One of her daughters informed the Cruise Critic community of her passing.\nToday’s afternoon tea setup.\n\n\n\nFood cart\n\n\n\n\n\nTea\n\n\nTonight’s dinner was in the Grand Dining Room. Becky had Shrimp Scampi, which she liked. I had Beef Wellington, which was good. I ordered it medium well, since last year when I ordered it medium, it was too rare. I think what the kitchen does is cook a slice a bit more to order from the bottom side. When I turned the meat over, the bottom side was brown, so overall it was cooked as ordered.\n\n\n\nShrimp Scampi\n\n\n\n\n\nBeef Wellington"

    "text": "San Francisco, Monday, September 30, 2024\nThe weather in San Francisco today was mostly sunny and warm. After morning coffee and breakfast we played golf and bean bag toss for points. We don’t know how many points we need to collect for Becky to get a jacket. The cruise staff will publish the redemption values for the prizes tomorrow. The amount of points needed for each item varies by the length of the cruise.\n\n\n\nWe ordered room service for lunch. Shrimp cocktail, vegetable California rolls, chicken Caesar salad, Tuscan kale salad and a Club sandwich.\n\n\nOur shore excursion started at 1pm and lasted until 5pm. The tour was called “Views Of San Francisco” and included three stops and a narrated drive through the city.\n\n\n\nThe first top was at the Gold Gate Park. Opened in 1937, the bridge is considered one of the seven engineering wonders of the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second stop was at the Sutro Baths, a massive swimming facility built at the ocean’s edge in 1894. In its heyday, the glamorous baths could accommodate 10,000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third stop was at Twin Peaks, where we saw views of the city and bay.\n\n\nThe tour was OK, not something we would have normally signed up for. The cruise fare included a $300 per person shore excursion credit, which we paid for since in the past we could opt out and the fare would be reduced by $300 per person. Today’s tour was $99 per person. I think we could have taken an Uber to the locations, then we would have been on our own schedule. We would have preferred to spend more time at Sutro Baths and less time at Gold Gate Park. Most tour stops were about 30 minutes. The narration given by the tour guide was good.\n\n\n\nThe Regatta departed San Francisco about 530pm. As we left the city, the wind was blowing and Becky wanted me to pretend I was a dog with my head out the window of a car. Alcatraz was in view.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we sailed out of the bay we got a nice view of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n\nWe ordered dinner from Polo Grill to be served in our cabin, which was served course by course. I had a crab cake and a pork chop and Becky had shrimp and more shrimp. Dessert was key Lime Pie.\n\n\n\nShrimp and crab cake\n\n\n\n\n\nShrimp and pork chop\n\n\n\n\n\nKey lime pie"

    "text": "Sea Day, en route to Ensenada, Mexico, Tuesday, October 1, 2024\nToday was a sea day en route to Ensenada. The weather was overcast and 70F.\n\n\n\nMorning coffee with a chocolate croissant.\n\n\nThe routine this morning was typical: shower, coffee, breakfast, golf putting and bean bag toss. At 11:30am the answers for the Art Scavenger Hunt were revealed and we got a perfect score, earning us 20 points each. In the afternoon, we redeemed our points for various gifts. Becky wanted to get a jacket, but they didn’t have her size and the next size up was too big. Her second choice was a shirt, hat and socks. One of the other passengers gave her about 25 points, so we will take the point cards home and use them on our next Oceania cruise in November of 2025.\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon we attended tea.\n\n\nWe ordered some drinks from the bar to take back to our room to have with our canapes\n\n\n\nBasket of crispy corn tortilla chips with Mexican salsa cruda. Mezze Platter – Hummus, Falafel, Spanakopita, Pita Bread, Lavash bread and Tzatziki dip Bowl of mixed nuts. Drinks - Regattare: Elijah Craig Small Batch Bourbon, Amare Averna, Aperol, Lemon juice, Simple Syrup, Vanilla Syrup. I thought the drinks were good, but Becky didn’t care for it.\n\n\nIn the evening we attended a party for passengers who have more than one cruise with Oceania.\nDinner tonight was in the main dining room.\n\n\n\nBecky had the Veal escalope – sauteed scaloppini, creamy mushroom sauce, candele pasta, which she liked.\n\n\n\n\n\nI had the grilled Korean style flank steak and vegetable stir fried rice. The steak was a little tough, and the spices were interesting, roasted coconut and garlic. I enjoyed the dish.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor dessert Becky had the chocolate brownie – Tahitian vanilla ice cream\n\n\n\n\n\nI had the lemon praline eclair – choux pastry, lemon marmalade, praline cream"

    "text": "Ensenada, Mexico, Wednesday, October 2, 2024\nThe weather in the was overcast with a marine layer that was expected to burn off mid morning, and the high temperature was 80F with an 8 mph wind. We had breakfast in the main dining room.\nOur tour group met on the pier at 10am for a tour called “VIP Wine Tasting With Gourmet Lunch”. The cost of the tour was $179 per person. Not a tour we would have chosen, but we needed to use up as much of the $300 per person non-refundable shore credit as possible without going over by too much. So in the end, we went under by $44. Being forced to take tours has not been popular with the Oceania customers, and as of October 1st, they have dropped this “benefit” along with the wine and beer by the glass at lunch and dinner. Now the complaints online are about the cruise line dropping the benefits and raising the prices. For our next cruise on Oceania, scheduled for November 2025, will be grandfathered under the old program and get the shore excursion credit and wine and beer at lunch and dinner.\n\n\n\nVines of Finca Tre.\n\n\nThe bus ride out to the winery took 45 minutes and the tour guide provided some narration to kill the time. When we got off the bus, it was hot. Down in the cellar it was much cooler. We were given two small samples of wine to taste. The first one was a rose and the second was a red blend. I thought both were OK, but the samples were too small. Next we went upstairs to a large covered patio with nice views of the vineyards. Since the patio was open air, it was hot and any breezes that did come by no matter how small were most welcomed but insufficient to cool us off.\n\n\n\nPouring the wine samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatio where lunch was served\n\n\nThe lunch was served in three courses, with the first being raw tuna on vegetables, jalapeños and diced garlic. There was some green sauce made from tomatillos. It took a while to get served our first wine, by which time we had finished the first course. I was expecting some explanation about the paring of the food with the wine, which was the same rose we sampled before. The amount poured was pitiful and after our food was long finished. Becky didn’t like her food, so I ate it. Only later, when we were back on the bus did we learn that the fish was tuna. The second course was some small lettuce leaves piled on some beef, which was good, but the wine didn’t come out until much later. And by much later, I mean like 20 minutes later. The waiters skipped our table and after seeing them on their phones back by the bar, I walked over to our tour guide and asked him to get our table served. A third small sample of wine was poured, a Shiraz, and not connected to any food. Dessert was a scoop of vanilla ice cream on a cookie, served in a glass cup. Over the top was poured some coffee with Kahlua and Baileys. The dessert reminded me of an affogato. Back on the bus, the tour guide asked the group if they liked the wines and food. He got silence from the group.\nWe sat at a table for four with a father and son from Los Angeles and we had fun talking to them. The dad was not shy about expressing his disappointment with the wine and service. As we were boarding the bus I told the tour guide in private that I had some constructive feedback for him. He thanked me and said that on the bus we would be filling out a comment sheet. When the shore excursion desk opened later in the afternoon, I went to offer my feedback. That evening I received a letter from the shore excursion desk saying that they would look into the matter. Since it was the last day of the cruise, there was not much that could be done.\n\n\n\nTwo of the wines we tasted. The red blend was $29 per bottle.\n\n\nWe were back on the ship by 2pm and we went to the spa to sit in the hot tub. We didn’t stay too long. At 4pm we attended tea for the last time.\nWe went to Martini’s bar for happy hour (two for one, $14). We need to spend the last of our onboard credit. We had a conversation with a couple from Maui and later we had dinner with them in the main dining room.\n\n\n\nWe ordered a drink called, Insignis – E11even vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice, lemon juice, caramel syrup, vanilla syrup. Very good.\n\n\nBack at the room, we finished packing and set out our large suitcase. By 10pm most of the suitcases had been picked up so I had to take mine down the hallway to where the luggage was being collected."

    "text": "Becky and I are on a seven night cruise from Los Angeles on Oceania Regatta (670-passengers, built in 1998). The cruise will stop at Catalina Island, San Francisco (overnight) and Ensenada, Mexico; and we will have two sea days. This will be our first cruise on Oceania Cruise lines.\nThe drive to the port of San Pedro took a little over two hours to cover the 82 miles from Ventura to the port in San Pedro during the weekday morning traffic. Google maps was reporting two accidents along Highway 101 in the San Fernando Valley and suggested an alternate route along Highway 1, which we took. The traffic was light until we reached Malibu and from there it was congested until Santa Monica.\nWe arrived at the cruise terminal parking lot around 10:20am and the lot was mostly empty, which was surprising. The Regatta was the only cruise ship in port and she had just finished a 13 day cruise from Vancouver to Los Angeles. We unloaded the car and rolled our bags to the terminal. We dropped our one check-on suitcase with the porters, fingers crossed that we would see it again later in the day. We’ve disembarked at the port of San Pedro many times before, usually at terminal 92, but this time our ship was docked at terminal 93 and the terminal layout is a bit different. We each had a small roll-on suitcase as our carry-on, and after security and x-ray of our bags, we took the elevator upstairs to the second floor to check-in. We were shown to a seating area to wait for check in to start at 11am.\nNo one at the check in counters. At 10:45am the check in desk started to get set up. Waiting for our group to be called.\nMost of the passengers were older than us. I think anyone we saw that was our age or younger, were adult children traveling with their parents.\nThe boarding is by cabin category - penthouse suites and above are the first group, the second group is concierge verandas followed by all other staterooms. Concierge veranda cabins are just regular balcony cabins with some added extras, such as, boarding in the second group, free laundry service and a welcome bottle of Champagne. The only reason to board early as possible is to secure additional reservations in the specialty restaurants, or so we thought.\nThe first group called was for guests in owner and vista suites. Only about six guests got up and the second group was for penthouse suites, which was our group. Check in took a little bit of time since the girl wasn’t familiar with the software and couldn’t scan our passports. After getting our ship key cards, we went to have our carryon bags x-rayed and walk through the metal detectors. From there we were able to board the ship.\nOur first stop was to the restaurant reservation desk to inquire about getting an additional restaurant reservation. Contrary to what we read on the internet, additional speciality reservations are not allowed.\nThe choices for embarkation lunch are either at Waves Grill or Terrace Café. Waves Grill is the pool deck burger bar and Terrace Café is the buffet. We headed to Waves Grill to get a table. The Waves Grill and Terrace Café are very near each other so food can easily be carried from one place to the other.\nBecky ordered the Surf & Turf sandwich - grilled Florida lobster medallions, sliced black angus filet mignon, tomato, toasted ciabatta, roasted garlic jus and remoulade dipping sauce. On the side came french fries and coleslaw.\nI ordered the Oceania Cuban sandwich – slow roasted marinated pork, ham, Swiss cheese, dill pickles, mustard, grilled Cuban bread with french fries.\nSince we didn’t have much for breakfast before leaving home, we were somewhat hungry. Becky thought her sandwich was just so-so. It was kind of hard for her to eat as a sandwich and she didn’t care for the bun. So she just scraped the lobster and filet mignon off the bread and ate the filling by itself, which she liked. So she ordered a second sandwich without the bread. I had a taste of lobster and filet mignon and they were good. My Cuban sandwich was good.\nSince our cabins were not ready, we decided to wait at Waves Grill, so I then ordered a strawberry milkshake - two scoops of whole milk ice cream and whipped cream. Then I walked over to the buffet to get a dessert, which Becky and I shared. By then it was about 12:30pm and Becky went off to explore while I waited with our carry on bags at the Waves Bar.\nShe came back only after a few minutes and said the doors to the cabin hallways were open, so we took that as a sign that our cabin was ready even though no announcements had been made. Outside our cabin we found our checked luggage waiting for us. Now it was time for us to check out our cabin, unpack and organize our stuff.\nLater, as we went out to explore the ship we met our butler, Richard, in the hallway along with our cabin attendant, Karen. The ship is not very big, so it didn’t take long to visit the library, casino, card room, internet office, Horizons lounge, spa. We also stopped by reception to inquire about some missing on board credit. We need to make a trip back to the room to get a printout from the booking agent showing our amenities, so that the office could follow up and make an inquiry back to headquarters.\nIn the afternoon, we ordered some room service snacks to have with our champagne. We ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip – crème fraiche, tomato salsa and tortilla chips; and a cheese plate – chutney, bread, crackers. The champagne was good, the nicest I’ve had in a long time. Often we have a bottle of bubbly waiting in our cabin when we check in, but it is usually something cheap, so Becky mixes it with OJ and I don’t even bother drinking it.\nDinner was in the Grand Dining Room which is what the main dining room is called on this ship. Dinner service started at 6pm and guests started to line up about 10 minutes early. When we got into line, there were about 20 people ahead of us. Menus change daily with a choice of 13 appetizers, soups and salads, 9 dinner entrées and 7 dessert items. In addition there are three suggested course pairings of the appetizer, second course, entree and dessert with a different theme each night. There is the Food & Wine pairing, the Global Cuisine lineup and the Aquamar Vitality Cuisine lineup. If you order the food and wine pairing, you don’t have to get the wine. These suggested pairings are a nice way to try different themed menus without having to think about things too much and experience items that I would not normally gravitate to. The Aquamar Vitality Cuisine consists of vegetarian selections and other plant-based dishes similar to a Mediterranean diet; and only for this line up are the calories, fat grams and grams of fiber listed. All the menu items have a little symbol next to the description which indicates if it is lacto-ovo vegetarian, plant-based or no-sugar-added.\nEarlier in the day, when we were out exploring the ship, we took some photos of the dining room.\nBecky ordered the following … Appetizer: chilled shrimp – horseradish spiked cocktail sauce Soup & salad: cream of cauliflower – with chicken quenelles. Didn’t get a photo of the soup. Entrée: Pork tenderloin medallions – asparagus, crabmeat, hollandaise sauce, gratinated polenta Dessert: vanilla soufflé with a cup of decaf Cappuccino.\nBecky didn’t like her entree that much. She also didn’t care for the dessert souffle. She gave it a rating of 4 out of 10 forks and didn’t finish her dinner or dessert.\nMy dinner order was … Appetizer: Roasted butternut squash – arugula, black radish, mango, hearts of palm Soup & salad: Sicilian salad - baby greens, onions, tomatoes, Italian black olives, capers, red wine vinaigrette Entrée: Tamarid-braised hamachi fillet – sweet ginger sauce, steamed rice, stir-fried vegetables Dessert: Mango sweet sticky rice with decaf Cappuccino\nI liked my dinner selections, I gave it 7 out of 10 forks. The roasted butternut squash was very nice and the pairing with the mango was good. The salad was typical. The fish for the main course reminded me of snapper. I didn’t care for the mango sweet sticky rice and I only ate half of it. I ordered it because I wanted to try new items. Besides, if I wanted more, I could always visit the buffet for my second dinner.\nAfter dinner we went to the show, called, ‘Broadway in Concert Starring the Regatta production singers, … lullabies of Broadway’. The performance was good and the singers were excellent. We didn’t know too many of the songs.\nOur cabin is a Penthouse Suite on deck 8 and has an advertised size of 322 square feet. The width of the cabin is about 4 feet wider than a standard balcony cabin which allows for a desk, chair and storage on the wall opposite from the bed while leaving ample room to walk around the bed. The closet is by the entry and has three doors with space for hanging clothes, some shelves and a room safe large enough to hold a laptop. In the closet are cotton bathrobes, slippers and cashmere lap blankets which can be used on the veranda during cold weather.\nThe bathroom has a shower stall, one sink with counter space on each side and storage behind the mirrors. The size of the bathroom is small and really only one person at a time can use the bathroom. The bath amenities are by Bulgari, which are the body wash, hair shampoo/conditioner and moisturizing lotion. I’m not a fan of the Bulgari products since I don’t like their scent.\nOutside the floor-to-ceiling windows and sliding glass door is a balcony with two chairs and a small table. The deck chairs can recline and are comfortable. The large windows that frame the ocean side of the cabin provide lots of light and nice views.\nAlso in the room is a television with on demand movies, ship’s information (map, weather, route, speed etc.) and our guest account balance.\nWhen we arrived at our cabin on the first day a bottle of Champagne was chilling in the ice bucket along with a complimentary Oceania Cruises logo tote bag.\nWe are bringing two bottles of wine and small containers of gin and bourbon from home. Oceania allows guests to bring up to six bottles of wine onboard to enjoy in their stateroom; or guests can pay a corkage fee and bring their wine to dinner or the public areas of the ship. Given that we can bring alcoholic beverages from home, we didn’t purchase a beverage package. Any drinks we purchase at the bars will be out of pocket. We plan to drink our cheap wine in our room.\nThe small room fridge is restocked daily with soft drinks and water. In the fridge we found Sprite which Becky wanted and there was a can of tonic water along with other assorted other sodas. I wanted the tonic water so that I could make gin and tonics. I don’t really like the taste of gin that much, so I dilute my gin with vodka. Besides cutting the flavor of gin, vodka is also good for spot cleaning clothes. Who knew that vodka was the universal solvent? Our butler said he would bring extras of whatever soda we liked.\nTwo bottles of water are provided to the room and replenished. The water is still Vero Water. Also provided are two stainless steel water bottles for use around the ship and to take home. Vero water is normal ship’s water that has been processed by a filtration system made by Vero. Vero’s purification and bottling process enables the ship to purify, chill, fill, and serve unlimited still and sparkling water on-site and on demand.\nOur cabin doesn’t have a coffee maker; 24 hour room service and 24 hour butler service is available, so in room coffee is available only by delivery via room service. The room service menu for penthouses suites is an expanded menu. Some cruise lines have started to charge for room service, but it’s included on Oceania. The butler service includes set up of in-suite dining, delivery of canapes (afternoon hors d’oeuvre) along with many other services that we don’t utilize such as packing and unpacking of our suitcases, garment pressing and shoe shine service.\nUnlimited WiFi for one device at a time is included in the fare. Becky and I aren’t big users of WiFi so we can easily have just one device connected at a time. I measured the WiFi speed, and it was about 4 Mbps for download and 2 Mbps for upload. When I’m in port, I use my mobile phone to connect to the internet and I get 52 Mbps of download speed and 38 Mbps of upload speed.\nBelgian chocolates are delivered with the nightly turndown service. We save these and bring them home.\nA complementary iPad upon request is available, which we didn’t ask for.\nAll the cabins have a daily service charge (the gratuity or tip), of $18 per person charged to the room. This covers services provided by the cabin steward, waiters and some of the other crew members. Additionally, there is a service charge of 20% added to drinks and spa services. Since we are staying in a penthouse there is an additional service charge of $5 per person per day for the butler.\nOverall, the room is very nice, with a coffee table, small dining table, vanity desk, sofa bed, large floor to ceiling windows and a sliding glass door leading to the balcony.\nWhen we leave our room in the morning for breakfast, we put a small card outside on the door and the attendant knows we are out and can make up the room. By the time we finish breakfast the room is done. The cabin is serviced twice per day, with the second service normally occurring while we are out for dinner and the show."

    "section": "Oceania Regatta – day 2",
    "text": "Oceania Regatta – day 2\nToday’s port is the town of Avalon on Catalina Island. Catalina Island is located about 29 miles south-southwest of Long Beach, California. The island’s population is around 4,000 people and most of them live in the city of Avalon. At day break the ship was anchored about a mile offshore. I was up early, took my shower and went off to get some coffee, while Becky took her shower. Morning coffee is available at the Terrace Cafe, deck 9 (one deck up), the Horizons bar, deck 10 (two decks up) or at Baristas Bar, three decks down on deck 5. This morning I decided to visit Baristas to have an Americano and a biscotti. The coffee shop opens at 6:30am and I was there about ten minutes before opening, so I set up my laptop with a table in the corner. There were a few others also waiting, with most getting coffee to go.\nBreakfast today was in the main dining room, but first we stopped at the coffee shop so that Becky could order a latte and a biscotti. For breakfast I ordered avocado toast which came with poached eggs. Becky had an omelet with a steak. We shared the steak since it was a bigger piece and more than Becky wanted. My poached eggs were cooked as I ordered them, well done, since I don’t like runny eggs. The avocado tasted a bit under ripe to me.\nAfter breakfast, we took the ship’s tender ashore for a little walk around town. The tender process on this ship requires those going ashore to stop by the theater and pick up colored tickets and wait for your group to be called. We didn’t have long to wait, maybe two or three minutes. The tender ride to shore took about 15 minutes and the seas were calm. The weather was cool and overcast.\nOur last visit to Avalon was probably 40 years ago. The town is a tourist beach town with a nice beach and shops and restaurants along Crescent Ave, which is a pedestrian promenade between the store fonts and the beach. We didn’t have any activities planned, so we walked along the street that runs along the beach and did some window shopping and took a few photos. The weather was overcast and the temperature was about 70F.\nThere is a nice beach and the water is very clear. Avalon has an underwater dive park and the giant kelp forests are world famous.\nWe had lunch in the buffet, called Terrace Cafe. The buffet is small compared to the larger ships we have been on and many of the items are the same as served in the main dining room. Seating is available both inside and outside on the rear lido deck. It’s at the buffet where the ship can get very crowded, especially at the start of meal times, when a lot of guests want to eat. Even though the passenger count is low, the number of tables in the buffet can’t accommodate the demand and people hoover around waiting to snag an empty table as soon as one frees up. Today they were serving crab cake sandwiches which sounded good.\nAfter lunch we put on our swimsuits and went to the Aquamare Spa sundeck, which is an exclusive area for suite guests and those with spa appointments. The spa sundeck has three sun beds and about six lounge chairs. The main attraction is the large Thalassotherapy Pool, basically a large hot tub. When we arrived there were only two other guests. So we had the hot tube and left side of the sun deck to ourselves. We stayed about an hour.\nThe next event was a mini golf and shuffleboard tournament held on the sports deck. At these events guests earn ‘O’ points, which are redeemable at the end of the cruise for prizes. We putted on holes 3, 6 and 9 and kept track of the number of puts and got points based on par.\nWe are also doing the art scavenger hunt. The object is to find the location of 60 works of art located around the ship based on visual clues on the answer sheet. This was a lot of fun and it took us a couple of days to find the locations, with the help of other passengers and some crew.\nOur canape order for today was California rolls and crudites with hummus.\nAt 5pm the captain hosted a welcome aboard party and the officers and top staff were introduced. During the party hors d’oeuvre were served and drinks at three of the bars were complementary from 5 until 8. So after our first welcome drink, we took a glass of wine to dinner.\nTonight’s dinner was at the Polo Grill, which is the steak house on the Regatta. Reservations are required for this restaurant, which Becky made prior to sailing since all reservation times are usually taken by the first day of the cruise. The cost of the restaurant is included in the cruise fare and there is no up-charge for lobster or other items as is typical on NCL. The menu is extensive with choices of 5 starter items, 4 soups, 5 salads, 6 cuts of beef (Porterhouse, Rib Eye, Filet Mignon, Bone-in Prime Rib), Pork Rib Chop, Grilled Rack of Lamb, Rotisserie Chicken. There are also five Signature dishes, six seafood dishes and 12 dessert choices. I didn’t snap any photos of our dinner items. We had a nice table for two next to the window.\nThe table next to us was a table for four. About 10 minutes after we were seated, a couple was seated at this table and the husband started to sit down across from the wife and she said to him, “not there, over here”, indicating that he should sit next to her. “But why?”, he said, “I want to sit here”. “Because we are sharing”, she said. “What?” “This is a sharing table”, she said a little louder. As soon as they were seated, the hostess brought over another couple, and they proceeded to have an awkward conversation in front of everyone. “I didn’t know we were sharing”, he said. “Yes, we’re sharing a table tonight”, she answered. Then they sat down and proceeded with introductions around the table. So apparently the husbands didn’t get the memo that dinner that night would be with strangers. During the course of the meal, the wife from the second couple dominated the conversation and seemed delighted to have someone else to talk to.\nThe problem with a small ship is that some venues don’t have enough seating capacity to accommodate all the guests. Seating in the buffet and at the specialty restaurants are the primary examples. Guests in penthouse suites and above can book dining reservations ahead of everyone else. So on the first day that the reservation window opened up, Becky made our reservations and secured tables for two at the specialty restaurants at our normal dining times. When the booking window opened for everyone else, I suspect that all the desirable times and preferred table sizes were no longer available.\nFor dinner tonight, Becky ordered … Appetizer: Colossal Chilled Shrimp Trio with Spicy Cocktail Sauce Soup & salad: New England Clam Chowder Entrée: Grilled Colorado Rack of Lamb (12 oz) with a side of Lobster Mac & Cheese Dessert: The Polo Quintet which consisted of bite size selections of the Executive Chef’s Favorite Desserts - Chocolate Fudge Brownie, Key Lime Pie, Caramelized New York Cheesecake, Crème Brûlée and Granny Smith Apple Crumb Pie Becky thought the shrimp trio was so-so. Everything else she liked. According to her, the dinner was 8 out of 10 forks.\nI ordered … Appetizer: Apple Cider Marinated, Slow-Roasted Pork Belly with Honey Soy Sauce Soup & salad: Beefsteak Tomato and Sweet Onion Salad Entrée: Filet Mignon (7 oz) with Hollandaise sauce and a side of onion rings Dessert: Key Lime Pie with Florida Orange Butter Sauce I like all my selections, except the Slow-Roasted Pork Belly. The Pork Belly was kind of bland tasting. I gave tonight’s dinner 6 out of 10 forks. The food was good, the steak cooked just as I ordered it and the Key Lime Pie was very good. But overall, I wasn’t blown away by the dining experience. It was on par with the steak house on the NCL ships. I suppose if I were a fan of lobster or something like a King’s Cut (32 oz) Bone-in Prime Rib, which are available without an up charge, unlike on NCL, then I would have awarded additional forks to my rating.\nThe show tonight was ‘Magic, fun and laughter’, which we didn’t attend.\n\n\n\nview of Regatta from tender\n\n\n\n\n\nbuffet\n\n\n\n\n\nart scavenger hunt sheet\n\n\n\n\n\nafternoon snacks\n\n\n\n\n\nscuba divers on the steps\n\n\n\n\n\nbreakfast poached eggs and avacodo toast\n\n\n\n\n\nloungers on the spa\n\n\n\n\n\nspa\n\n\n\n\n\nbeach in Catalina\n\n\n\n\n\nsidewalk in Cataline"

    "text": "Oceania Regatta – day 3\nToday is a sea day and we are en route to San Francisco. I got up early as I normally do, took my shower and went out to get some coffee. This morning I decided to visit the Horizon lounge and make a cup of coffee using the self service coffee machines. Later when Becky was ready, we went to Barista’s to get Becky’s morning cappuccino and I had a cup of Americano with a biscotti. Breakfast this morning was in the Grand Dining Room. I had a small bowl of Greek yogurt along with scrambled eggs, hash browns and a side of bacon. Becky had oatmeal followed by French Toast.\nI really like the Americano coffee from these machines. In fact, I prefer the coffee here over the coffee made in Barista’s coffee bar.\nA wide angle view of Barista’s Coffee bar. Barista’s is located just outside the Grand Dining Room and is a nice place to meet for coffee before breakfast. Here you can order lattes and bring them into the dining room for breakfast. In the dining room, only drip coffee or cappuccino are served. In the afternoon, some alcoholic beverages are available from Barista’s. I think it was limited to wine, champagne and regular martinis.\nOur first activity of the morning was miniature golf in the Horizon’s lounge, immediately followed by bean bag toss. About 50 guests showed up for this event. The main reason to attend is to collect ‘O’ points and chit-chat with fellow cruisers. For miniature golf, the staff had set up three holes and you got three chances to make a hole, with one point earned for each hole. Becky and I can usually make two or three holes. The bean bag (or corn hole as it’s sometimes called) is more challenging. Two guests go at a time and compete against each other, with the winner getting two points and the loser getting one.\nThree puts are allowed at each hole. Points range from three to one, where zero holes will still earn you one point.\nAfter mini golf, we worked on the art scavenger hunt, which we really enjoyed. I like looking at art and the scavenger hunt really forced you to look at all the pieces in detail, because the clue was usually just a small snippet taken from a section of the art, sculpture, photo or signage. Most of the art on the ship is abstract and much of it looks very similar to the abstract art we have seen on other Norwegian ships.\nA painting was in the stairway between decks 3 and 4. The clue was a snippet of the buildings near the top of the painting.\nThe vase was on deck 10, near the aft elevators and the clue was a photo of just the tip top of the vase.\nWe had lunch in the Terrace Cafe (the ship’s buffet) located on the aft lido deck. Seating areas line the windows port and starboard. At the back, doors lead to an outdoor seating area with round tables for four, topped by umbrellas. In most instances servers will dish out your foods rather than letting you help yourself. All three meals are served here. Lunch and dinner choices include items on the main dining room menu, so at least for lunch and dinner, the food varies. Today’s theme for the lunch menu was Mexican and it was very crowded when it opened.\nBuffet indoor seating. During busy times, you need to grab your table and put down your jacket, book or something to hold your table before going off to get your food. Or just wait for about an hour after opening and by then the feeding frenzy would have subsided.\nAfter lunch we wandered around the ship working on the art scavenger hunt. The Regatta is the smallest cruise ship we have been on. The only other small cruise ship we have experienced was on our first cruise back in 1992, on NCL’s Southward, a 802 passenger vessel. The Regatta can carry 670 passengers and has a crew of 386. Exploring a new ship is kind of fun and doing the art scavenger hunt was a fun excuse to wander around. There are nine decks open to passengers, starting with deck 3 and going to deck 11. Deck 3 has about 15 ocean view cabins (143 to 165 square feet in size).\nDeck 4 has the Reception Desk, Destination Services, the Concierge, the Medical Center and ocean view and inside cabins (160 square feet). About eight of the paintings or sculptures on this deck were part of the art scavenger hunt.\nDeck 5 has the main dining room called the Grand Dining Room, a coffee shop called Baristas & The Grand Bar, the shops, a martini bar called Martinis, the casino and main stage called the Lounge. Several art scavenger hunt items were in the Grand Dining Room and Baristas. Fabric pattern on the dining room chairs and the design on the carpet were items we needed to locate.\nThe lobby for the ship spanned two floors, with a ‘grand’ staircase connecting the two levels. On most days, a stringed quartet would play, and the selections ranged from pop melodies to well known classics. I would think to myself, “I know that song … that’s ‘Let it Be’, by the Beatles.”\nThis is the martini bar, called Martini’s and is also the casino bar. We planned to have drinks here during the cruise, but we never made it. During happy hour, when two for one drinks were served, it was always full.\nMore scavenger hunt art was behind the piano in Martini’s bar. In the evening someone would play and sing songs. But we were always busy doing other stuff, usually having a long dinner, so we never got the chance to have a drink here and listen to the music.\nThe casino is small with about 50 slot machines, one roulette, three blackjack tables and one poker table. There was one art scavenger hunt item in the casino and it was on one of the slot machines.\nThe main stage is were three or four art scavenger hunt items were in here.\nOn decks 6, 7 and 8 there are cabins of various categories - Owners suites (1000 square feet), Vista suites (786 square feet), penthouse suites (322 square feet), veranda (216 square feet) and inside cabins.\nDeck 9 has the buffet called the Terrace Café, an outdoors burger bar called Waves Bar & Grill, the lido deck where the pool and two hot tubs are located, the ships spa called Aquamar, the internet center and the card room.\nHere is a view of the pool deck and jogging track on decks 9 and 10. The pool is small, but I never saw more than three people in it. On the last day of the cruise, Becky and I took a dip in the pool, the water was warm and the depth of the pool was maybe four and a half feet deep. All the loungers around the pool have terry cloth covers and the cushions on the daybeds and loungers are comfortable. There were always loungers available both in the sun and in the shade. This is in stark contrast to the other cruise ships we’ve been on, where the pool deck is packed and chair hogs reserve loungers early in the morning with books and personal beach towels.\nWe found more scavenger hunt art in the card room. This room was often full of passengers playing card or board games.\nDeck 10 has the Italian restaurant called Toscana, the steak house called Polo Grill, the library, fitness track and the forward observation lounge called Horizons. The scavenger hunt art located in Toscana, and the Polo Grill could not be accessed during the day because the doors were closed.\nLibrary has polished dark wood on the walls and a mural on the ceiling which is painted to look like the sky with some tropical trees and birds. There is a faux fireplace with umbrella stands on either side. There were several scavenger hunt art items in the library.\nThere are some leather chairs in the library and they must be extremely comfortable because on many days, I saw passengers sleeping here.\nOn deck 11 is the sports deck with shuffleboard and golf putting greens as well as a sun deck.\nOn the outdoor putting green each hole was par 3 and we would count the number of strokes to get three holes. The staff would typically pick holes 1, 3 and 7 for the group to do, that way several golfers could be working the course at once.\nShuffleboard was hard to do. All my shots were either long or too short.\nWe worked on the art scavenger hunt until it was time for the bracelet craft hour. We sat with Laurie, who we had met earlier when doing the scavenger hunt. The bracelet craft was a small kit consisting of beads and a short length of elastic string.\nAt 4pm tea is served in the horizon lounge. A selection of traditional and herbal teas were served while a string quartet played softly on the stage. The staff brought around pastry carts filled with finger sandwiches, petits fours, scones with whipped cream and jam along with other desserts. The daily variety of finger sandwiches were good. The carrot curry and shrimp avocado sandwiches were unusual and really good. Everything on the pastry carts looked good and all my selections tasted really good, unlike on NCL where often the desserts can look good but don’t really taste as good as they look. Bill and Laurie joined us for tea. They are from Springfield Missouri, Bill is 56 and Laurie just turned 60. We ran into Bill and Laurie on the first day when I saw them doing the art scavenger hunt.\nBill is a college instructor and teaches Library Science courses. He was usually busy in the morning doing zoom meetings. Laurie carried her knitting and craft projects with her and was always working on something.\nAfter tea we went back to our room to relax and change into our dinner clothes. But first, I went to the trivia event, also where you can earn ‘O’ points, but only the top three teams are awarded points. Up to six people can be on a team and it looked like most of the teams had already been established before the cruise. I found out later that repeat Oceania cruisers organize their teams on Facebook ahead of the cruise. So I just played solo, since I wouldn’t be playing any more trivia on this cruise. There were 15 questions with one bonus question worth two points. The top score was 12, I was able to get five correct answers.\nWe had dinner in the Grand Dining Room with Bill and Laurie and later we went to the show, which was a tribute to Motown. The singers were very good and the show was entertaining. The singers and dancers have other duties such as running the mini-golf, bean bag and shuffle board activities."

    "text": "Oceania Regatta – day 4: San Francisco\nThis morning the Regatta sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge into San Francisco Bay in the darkness of early morning. I was up in Horizon’s Lounge having my morning coffee as we approached the entrance to the bay.\nLater Becky and I stopped by Barista’s for Becky’s latte and Laurie was also there having coffee. I had a second cup of coffee along with a small biscotti. After a few minutes, Bill joined us and the girls ordered a second latte to take to breakfast.\nThis is the display case for selfservice cookies, pastries and small sandwiches in the afternoon. This photo was taken later in the day and you can see the small sandwiches.\nAfter breakfast Becky and I stopped by our room to freshen up before heading upstairs to the Horizon’s Lounge for the morning session of mini golf and bean bag. I discussed our plans for the day with Bill and they agreed to accompany us on a hike to Coit Tower. Coit Tower is a 210-foot tower in the Telegraph Hill neighborhood which overlooks the city and the bay. The tower was a short half mile walk uphill from the pier where the Regatta docked. None of us had been to the tower before.\nLooking out the windows in the Horizon Lounge at the docks and buildings we could see a tall narrow tower on the top of the hill which is the Coit Tower.\nFrom the top of the tower looking north, you can see the Regatta at dock and Alcatraz Island in the bay.\nLooking west, we could see a park and bell towers of a church, so we decided to walk over that way.\nOn the way back to the waterfront we came to a farmers market. I bought a bottle of wine and Bill bought a bottle of balsamic vinegar.\nAfternoon canapes are delivered by our butler. We can select two items from a list of 10, which we put out in the morning. The snack arrived about 5pm each day which we would have with a small glass of wine before going out for dinner.\nVegetable spring rolls with sweet chili sauce on the left and Mezze Platter – Hummus, Falafel, Spanakopita, Pita bread and Tzatziki on the right. Other selections we ordered throughout the week – California Rolls, Olives and Nuts, Assorted fine cheeses with grapes, nuts and crackers, vegetable sticks (crudites), crispy corn tortilla chips with salsa.

    "text": "Oceania Regatta – day 5\nToday the Regatta is tied to the pier in San Francisco until 9pm. We had breakfast with Bill and Laurie and then we all went upstairs to play mini golf and bean bag; we needed to work on earning our daily quota of ‘O’ points. Bill and Laurie had plans to do more exploring of San Francisco. Becky and I had a few things to do on board.\nBack at the room I called AARP to inquire about our missing on-board credit. We didn’t get a satisfactory answer from them. We then put on our swimsuits and headed up one floor to Aquamare Spa. The hot tub has been very hot and we can only spend about five to ten minutes in there. Since the Regatta is a small ship the spa is also small. The men’s locker room has two small showers and a steam room. On the larger NCL ships when we have been given access to the spa facilities, I’ve used the shower and sauna and they are stocked with men’s bath products. I didn’t see any shampoo or soap in the men’s shower, which I thought was unusual. They did have two small baskets of cheap plastic combs and disposable razors for guests to take and use.\nWe had lunch at Wave’s Grill and I had the Cuban sandwich again. Becky repeated the steak and lobster without the bread. Back in the room Becky watched a movie and I took a nap. At 2pm we went up to deck 11 to play mini golf on the outside course and then at 4pm we joined Bill and Laurie for afternoon tea.\nTonight’s dinner was at Toscana, the Italian dinner-only venue. Reservations are required and there is no charge to dine here. The restaurant is in an L-shaped room lined with windows, facing either port or aft. The decor is elegant with beige brocade napery and Versace china rimmed in blue with gold scrolls. The menu is extensive, printed on one page with small letters and is divided into sections. Reading glasses are definitely required. It’s such a large menu with so many interesting selections that it was hard to choose what to have. There is also an Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar menu with 10 olive oils and three balsamic vinegars. These are poured onto a small plate for dipping the bread into. The bread basket has a tempting selection of different types of focaccia, breadsticks and little cheese-covered rolls. The olive oil and balsamic vinegar choices were described by the server as ‘fruity’, ‘earthy’ or something else, maybe ‘light’, I don’t remember. He didn’t offer any choices for the balsamic vinegar. I chose the ‘fruity’, which was a darker green than what Becky chose. The bread basket placed at our table also had a clove of roasted garlic.\nBecky had reserved a table, which was by the window. The restaurant was mostly full and we noticed that some guests were offered a sharing table or a two topper against the back wall. Even though these tables were technically two toppers, they were placed so close together that you might as well be sharing. Other guests who came later sat at a four topper, but did have to share.\nBecky’s selections for dinner were … Appetizer: Code di Scampi avvolte nel Prosciutto Crudo di Parma - Sautéed Jumbo Shrimp tenderly wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma and served with Candied Cherry Tomato Soup & salad: Fritto di Calamari con Salse a Scelta - Lightly Breaded Baby Calamari served with Spicy Marinara or Aioli Sauce Entrée: Filetto di Manzo alla Fiorentina con Crosta al Gorgonzola - Filet Mignon in Gorgonzola Crust with Sautéed Garlic Spinach, Grilled Polenta and Brunello Red Wine Sauce Dessert: Tiramisú - Classic Italian Favorite of Mascarpone Cream, Lady Fingers Soaked in Espresso, Amaretto and Aged Brandy\nBecky liked all of her selections except the Calamari, which she thought was kind of rubbery. Also the Filet Mignon was too much for her to eat, so I had about one third of it. She rated her dinner a 7 out of 10 forks.\nMy selections for dinner were … Appetizer: Mozzarella di Bufala Caprese - Tower of Fresh Bufala Mozzarella and Vine-Ripened Tomatoes with Basil and Extra Virgin Olive Oil Emulsion Soup & salad: Zuppa Di Fagiolie Salciccia - white beans, sweet sausage, pasta Entrée: Branzino Del Mediterraneo - Mediterranean sea bass, fennel-saffron, piedmont hazelnuts, capers, lemon confit Dessert: Toscana Quintet - A selection of five bite size traditional desserts Tortino Di Cioccolata Fondente – molten dark chocolate cake, Sicilian blood orange sauce Tiramisu – red berries tiramisu Crostatina Di Albicocche – crispy apricot tart, pistachio cream Biscotto Di Mandorle e pesche – almond biscuit, roasted peaches, amaretto zabaglione Cappuccino alla crema di castagne – chestnut cream cappuccino, meringue, white chocolate foam\nI liked all my selections. The soup was very good, the best Zuppa Di Fagiolie I’ve ever had. Maybe next time, I’ll just order soup to have with the bread. The Mediterranean sea bass was good, but not spectacular. By the time dessert was served, I was full and only took one bite from each of the five items. The custard in the center cup with the raspberry was good. The only thing that wasn’t that good was the whipped cream thing on the lower right. I gave my dinner 8 out of 10 forks, the soup was the highlight of the meal.\nWe both ordered cappuccinos to have with dessert."

    "text": "Oceania Regatta – day 6\nToday is a sea day and we are en route to Ensenada, Mexico, the mandatory foreign port as required by the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also known as the Jones Act. Our morning routine was a repeat of previous mornings – coffee, breakfast, mini-golf, bean bag etc.\nToday was the art scavenger hunt reveal and we each got 20 ‘O’ points for completing the challenge. In the afternoon the ‘O’ points were redeemed for prizes. We had enough points to each get a nice activewear t-shirt. In the afternoon we ordered club sandwiches from room service for lunch.\nToday we receive our loyalty gifts from Oceania as first time cruisers: pins and luggage tags. The next milestone gift is given at five cruises, which are baseball hats and a messenger bag. Earlier in the week Bill and Laurie shared a table in one of the specialty restaurants with an elderly couple named Elizabeth and Thomas. Thomas was in a wheelchair that night and Laurie helped Thomas and Elizabeth get back to their room. Anyway, this morning at breakfast, Elizabeth and Thomas (using a cane) sat at the table next to the four of us and they were wearing their new baseball hats. They said they didn’t want the messenger bag and that Becky could have it. So later we dropped by their cabin to pick it up. The bag is OK, I might use it when I bring my laptop to the coffee shop.\nWe are now at the Blue level (1 to 4 Oceania cruises).\nBecky’s entrée for dinner was a lobster dish and I had Beef Wellington. I ordered it medium, but it came out a bit too rare for me, so I just ate around the edges."

    "text": "Oceania Regatta – day 7\nToday was the final full day of the cruise. Today’s port is Ensenada, Mexico; we didn’t get off the ship. Our morning routine was a repeat of previous mornings – coffee, breakfast, mini-golf, bean bag etc. Except that no ‘O’ points were given out. The same crowd of passengers showed up.\nBecky and I went to the spa, the main pool and had lunch at Waves. Bill and Laurie showed up at Waves around 1pm and sat with us while they ate a late lunch. They had been on a shore excursion. Back at our cabin, Becky watched a movie and I took a nap on the veranda. We also started packing.\nIn the afternoon we attended a musical performed by the cruise director. The music was a set of Broadway songs and narration that told the story of his life. He has a nice voice and before working on cruise ships attended college as a theater major and performed in plays and musicals.\nFor dinner we ordered room service. Passengers with butlers can order course by course in suite dining. So in the afternoon, we informed our butler, Richard, that we would be dining in our suite and we left him a note that contained our selections. We ordered food from Toscona’s. Toscona’s is one of restaurants that we tried to secure an additional reservation for on the first day, but was not allowed since the cruise line needed to allow all the passengers an opportunity to dine at the specialty restaurants at least once on the voyage; which is fair. So instead, we planned to take advantage of the in suite dining.\nFirst course was the appetizer and salad items. We drank the remaining wine from our carry-on wine and a bread basket was also delivered, but without olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. The three plates are: Sliced Eggplant rolled and sautéed with Roasted Minced Veal Stuffing and Basil, baked in Fresh Tomato Sauce, Sautéed Jumbo Shrimp wrapped in Prosciutto and a salad. After about 30 minutes, Richard returned to remove the dishes and serve the next course.\nRichard deboned the Dover Sole. The Dover Sole was recommended online as one of the items not to miss.\nThe second course was the entrees. We ordered: Dover Sole sautéed in Lemon, Parsley and Butter with Steamed Potatoes, Lasagne made with fresh handmade pasta layered with Béchamel Sauce, grated Parmigiano Reggiano and minced Beef Tenderloin with garlic and fresh herbs, and a trio of Gnocchi (potato dumplings in a pesto sauce), Fettuccine and Risotto.\nBecky and I shared the entrees. The Dover Sole and the Lasagne were excellent. On a previous cruise, I had Dover Sole in Le Bistro, the French restaurant on NCL. NCL has an up-charge for the Dover Sole. When we were given a free meal at Le Bistro, I ordered the Sole. I was not impressed; it was bland and mushy. The Dover Sole from Toscona’s was light, flaky and had a light brown crust from the pan searing. The Lasagne was meaty and very tasty. After about 30 minutes, Richard returned to remove the plates. We didn’t order anything for dessert.\nAfter dinner, we finished packing our large suitcase and set it out in the hallway."

We had Silver #3 luggage tags, so we waited until Silver #2 was called before leaving our room. Down in the casino and Martini’s Bar, guests were waiting for their group to be called. I figured it was about time for our group to be called, so we headed for the door. There was no line, we showed our key card for the final time and walked down the gangway. Inside the terminal, I found our bag with the Silver #3 group, but it took a bit of searching. Re-entry to the USA was done by facial recognition, no lines and very quick. Exit from the terminal was on the far end of the building from where we originally arrived, so next time, I’ll park my car on that side of the parking lot.\nBy 9am we were in the car, driving home. Along the way, Google was suggesting alternate routes to avoid slow downs and traffic head. I took the first suggestion, exited the freeway, drove along some neighborhood streets and then was routed to an on ramp which was closed. After passing the closed on ramp, Google routed me to the next on ramp and I decided to just stay on the freeway and ignore future suggested deviations. The car pool lane was flowing at a good rate, which I don’t think Google was taking into consideration. After two hours of driving across LA, we made it home.\nBreakfast: Omelets with bacon and hash browns, yogurt, bagel, danish, OJ and grilled lamb chops."

    "text": "Final thoughts\nThe Regatta is the smallest cruise ship we have been on. The only other small cruise ship we have experienced was our first cruise back in 1992, on NCL’s Southward, a 802 passenger vessel, built in 1971. The Regatta can carry 670 passengers and has a crew of 386. This gives a passenger to crew ratio of 1.7, which is below 2 and is one of the parameters that define a luxury cruise. Another parameter is the passenger to space ratio, which is calculated by dividing the ship’s gross tonnage by the number of passengers; for the Regatta, this number is 45.2. A number above 50 would indicate that the ship is spacious relative to the passenger load. At 45.2, this number is only slightly higher than large cruise ships like NCL’s Bliss which comes in at 42 or the world’s largest cruise ship, the Wonder of the Seas (Royal Caribbean) which has a passenger to space ratio of 41.3.\nBased on my research, I think the main differences between the standard, deluxe and ultra-luxury cruise lines are, besides the price, are the passenger to crew ratio and the passenger to space ratio. The ultra-luxury cruise lines, such as Regent, Silversea and Seabourn, have passenger to crew ratios closer to one to one, and passenger to space ratios above 50 and sometimes closer to 70. The ultra-luxury cruise lines also tend to be all-inclusive with drinks, shore excursions and gratuities included in the fare.\nOceania Cruises operates seven small cruise ships and Oceania markets itself as having “The Finest Cuisine at Sea”. The other way Oceania describes their ships is - the ultimate small ship experience for travel adventures. Oceania fits into the deluxe or luxury cruise line niche and competes with brands such as Viking Ocean Cruises or Azamara Cruises that operate small to midsize ships. These brands claim to offer finer amenities and a more upscale environment to accompany their elevated prices.\nThe food on the Regatta was good. The service was good. The entertainment was good. I disembarked a satisfied customer. The thing about being on a small ship is that there are fewer bars, fewer restaurants, less entertainment, a smaller experience and a smaller daily program. There was limited availability for restaurant reservations for those guests with a low priority. The buffet was crowded for the first hour after opening. What was offered was high quality food, large expansive menus, sophisticated dishes and no menu up charges. The ship had the vibe of an exclusive country club. All the guests were well behaved, had good manners and knew how to queue for events.\nThe passengers were for the most part older than 60 and usually traveling as couples. I only saw one person who I thought was traveling solo. I didn’t see any children on this voyage and 30 somethings appeared to be traveling with their parents.\nThe free WiFi was slow and only good for email and checking the news or weather. Bill had purchased the WiFi upgrade and he said it worked well for his video conferences. Becky and I shared the WiFi and it was easy to knock the other off line when needed."

    "section": "Thursday: Travel day – flying to Miami",
    "text": "Thursday: Travel day – flying to Miami\nBecky and I flew to Miami to catch a seven day Caribbean cruise on the Norwegian Joy. The cruise is a round trip from Miami, and we will stop at four ports: Roatán in Honduras, Harvest Caye (NCL’s private island) in Belize, Costa Maya in Mexico and Cozumel in Mexico. Along the way we will have two sea days.\nOur trip started with an early morning drive to Van Nuys to catch the Flyaway bus to LAX to catch a 6:15am departure to Miami on American Airlines.\nWe got up at 1am and left the house at 2:10am. There was no traffic along the way, but there was a bit of fog. We made it to the bus terminal by 3am and by 3:30am we were on the bus headed to LAX. By 4:30am we had our bags checked, made it through security and sat at the gate for about one hour until boarding.\nOur flight to Miami lasted about 5 hours. We departed at sunrise and flew east over Los Angeles and Arizona. At some point there were too many clouds below us to see the land.\nWe were served pre-takeoff beverages, I had a coffee with Baileys and Becky had orange juice with vodka. We were served omelets for breakfast. I started the second chapter of “How the Irish Saved Civilization”, which I’m finding very interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were served pre-takeoff drinks, a small cup of coffee and a screwdriver. We could hear the other passengers ordering champagne, coffee and beer. As we pulled away from the gate, the flight attendant came by to collect the cups and told those who had not finished their drinks to hold them in their hands during take off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwiss cheese omelet, Italian chicken sausage, seasoned potatoes, fresh fruit and yogurt.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter collecting our bags, which took about 30 minutes, we went outside to the hotel shuttle pick-up spot. The temperature outside was in the low 70’s. When we got on the van there were two guys sitting in the front of the van, which seemed a bit unusual when I thought about it later. We were waiting at door number three, so I told Becky that we still have to pick up at the other terminals so the van might get crowded. We made it almost to the last terminal before stopping where the two guys got out. So Becky and I moved up to the first row in the van, since a big group of people were getting on. That way she could get off the bus first and get us checked in, or so we thought. It took a while to get everyone’s bags loaded and for them to all get aboard. Then the two guys who had been in the van when we boarded got back on.\nI said to one of them, ‘sorry, we took your seats, I didn’t know you were coming back.’\nHe said, ‘no worries, we had to return a bag and thought we would be catching the next van’. Then he proceeded to explain that he had picked up someone else’s bag and got a call from the airline asking if they had the wrong bag, which they did, and that’s why they were back at the airport.\nAt the hotel, the desk clerk would not let Becky check us in since the reservation was in my name. Becky said, “But he’s right outside collecting our bags.”\n“I need to see him face to face”, was his answer.\nBy then, the large group was lining up behind Becky when I showed up and we proceeded with the check-in. The leader of the large group, and we could tell they all knew each other by the conversations in the van, was informed that he was at the wrong hotel. We never asked the driver which address he was going to and just assumed we were going to ‘our’ hotel. Lucky for us, we were in the right van. Becky had gotten the instructions and was told to just get on the red Town Place hotel van, like there would only be theirs that pick up at the Miami airport.\nDinner was Cuban sandwiches from a nearby Cuban restaurant, which was about a five minute walk. They were good but a little too much bread and meat."

    "section": "Friday: Miami, pre-cruise stay",
    "text": "Friday: Miami, pre-cruise stay\nOur pre cruise hotel was the TownePlace Suites by Marriott, about one mile from the Miami Airport terminal. We flew into Miami two days prior to our cruise to ensure that we would make it to Miami for our cruise. Flying in two days early means that we probably could make the cruise even if we experienced a big delay or missed our flight. On the other hand it means that we have a full day in Miami without much to do.\nThe hotel has a complimentary breakfast each morning. Breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage biscuit, oatmeal, cheese, yogurt, muffin and coffee. Overall the free breakfast was adequate but mediocre. I took two yogurts to eat later. The only complaint about the hotel is the low flow shower head, it’s really low flow.\nThe weather today was clear and calm in the morning, but in the afternoon it was partly cloudy and windy.\nThere was a Target store and shopping center located about a 15 minute walk away. The Target store looked brand new. It was the biggest and nicest Target store I’ve ever seen. Becky bought some wool winter socks. Why do people in Miami need wool socks? Who knows. We visited a Walgreens, a liquor store, a store called Government Discount, which reminded me of a Big Lots, but it was bigger. We also took a look at a grocery store called Fresco y Mas.\nOn our walk back to the hotel we bought burritos at a place Becky found on-line called Taqueria Los Potrillos. We bought chicken burritos which were very good. In fact, we both thought they were much better than the Cuban sandwiches we had yesterday.\n\n\n\nOur hotel room was a good place to watch the planes landing at the Airport. In the morning around 9am, a new plane would land every 2 minutes. Later it was less frequent and in the afternoon, it was every 10 minutes or so."

    "text": "Saturday: Embark NCL Joy\nI was up early since I couldn’t sleep. I took an early shower and made a cup of coffee and it rained overnight, the forecast calls for clearing weather later in the day.\nWe had a light breakfast at the hotel. Breakfast room was more crowded than the day before and there were lines for the food, coffee and waffle maker. We had some coffee and a ham and egg breakfast sandwich. We were done in about 10 minutes. We didn’t need to fill up since we would be getting food on the ship. Back in the room we finished packing up and decided to schedule a Lyft pickup for 9:40am. Our port check-in time that was assigned 21 days ago was for 9:30am to 10am and the drive from the hotel was only 20 minutes. The Lyft driver arrived about 20 minutes early. We could see his car from our 6th floor window and then I got a text from him saying he had arrived. So I answered back and we went downstairs to check out of the hotel and get our bags loaded in his car.\nHe asked us, ‘Is music Okay?’ We said yes, and he put on some Cuban Salsa music. He was a very aggressive driver and liked to change lanes a lot and got honked at several times.\nAt the terminal we dropped our check on bags with a porter and proceeded into the terminal. NCL’s terminal was finished just as COVID started and sat unused for much of the pandemic. The terminal is a nice big terminal with very high ceilings and big glass walls that are about six stories high. We have been in the terminal for two other cruises. The acoustics in the terminal are poor and it’s hard to make out what the announcements are saying. The volume is loud enough, but there’s so much other noise in the room. Also the bathrooms are in short supply, as well as seating when the terminal gets full. Lots of passengers end up either sitting on the floor or standing around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCL Terminal, main hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCL Terminal, security\n\n\n\n\n\nOn this cruise we are staying in a suite, so we got to wait in the VIP section, which has a special check in area, with a separate elevator and security checkpoint.\nI tried to sneak two mini bottles of Baileys Irish cream (that we got from the airline) through the security checkpoint, but got caught. The bottles were confiscated and I’ll need to pick them up at the end of the cruise at the terminal’s guest services office. The security guard saw the bottles in my pockets and asked me to empty my pockets and put the contents in the tray for x-ray. I was given the option to pay $15 per bottle corkage fee. I wanted to sneak the bottles on to avoid having to pick them up later, so my plan failed. I should have just left the bottles loose in my carry-on suitcase, because I don’t think they are checking that close.\nThe VIP section of the terminal is elevated above the main waiting floor and from there we can see all the security operations and waiting area for regular passengers. On a previous cruise we could somewhat see the VIP guests if they were standing at the rail. Since it was our first time up in the VIP section we were taking lots of pictures. At some point, security came up to Becky and told her no photography is allowed. He said, ’you need to delete all those pictures you took.’ And he waited while Becky moved the photos to the trash can, then showed the security guy and he left. We don’t remember seeing any signs, but I guess it’s like airport TSA where no photos are allowed. Did he really think the photos were permanently deleted or was that just for show? Later, we saw other guests taking photos of the same areas, but the terminal was much more crowded by then and maybe security had other things to do besides keeping an eye out for people taking pictures. We each got busted for something, not a good start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIP waiting area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIP coffee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIP snacks\n\n\n\n\n\nBoarding didn’t start until about two hours after we arrived, sitting in the VIP waiting area with coffee and snacks was nice. I had a cup of coffee and it was the strongest coffee I’ve seen in a long time; I needed to dilute it by 50% with hot water. The only snacks I had were some cookies, which were very good with the coffee.\nGetting on the ship was not that smooth of a process. There were several hundred VIP guests and we were led as a group to the gang way for boarding, but the key card readers stopped working, so we had about a 20 minute wait. Then once on board there was another wait for the elevators to take the suite guests to deck 17, where most of their rooms are located. Becky and I skipped the elevator line and went to our cabin to drop off our carry-on bags. Then we went down to the cruise next desk to sign up for the week’s events.\nOur cabin on this cruise is on deck 12 and is a forward facing penthouse with a side balcony. The cabin (414 square feet in area) has a separate bedroom and living area. The balcony for our cabin was on the small side at 27 square feet in area. Since the cabin is forward facing we have a large porthole window with a view of the front of the ship and the wall on this side of the cabin is sloped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving room view from balcony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBathroom sinks, toilet and shower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTub and vanity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBedroom and forward window\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to sailing Becky requested room amenities of plain and peanut M&M’s, gummy bears, extra firm pillows, orange juice (for the sparkling wine) and milk for coffee. The only item missing was the extra firm pillow for me, but I didn’t notice it wasn’t delivered until bed time. I never did ask for the extra firm pillow since the regular ones were fine. Our cabin comes with access to the Haven exclusive areas which include the Haven Horizon Lounge, Haven pool, sun deck and the Haven dining room, which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the first day we had received a table full of stuff. Two bowls of M&Ms (peanut and mini), gummy bears, a bottle of Merlot, two bottles of sparkling wine and chocolate covered strawberries.\n\n\nAfter dropping off our bags in our cabin, we went out to explore the ship. The Joy had just come out of dry dock and there were some changes made to the ship since we last cruised on her. The spa received a big upgrade with additional features added like a thermal pool (hot tub), hot sauna and a steam room and a rain shower (kind of hard to describe). To make room for the added spa features, the Galaxy Pavilion was removed; the Galaxy Pavilion was a large virtual reality arcade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy’s main pool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaven pool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaven Horizon Lounge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSail away cake in the buffet, served during lunch on embarkation day.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater we had lunch in the Haven dining room. I had a Cobb salad and Becky had the Shrimp scampi and we shared the Seafood Fritto Misto (Fried calamari, shrimp, scallops, onions, zucchini and remoulade sauce). After lunch we went to the buffet, which was very crowded, to look at the special desserts on the first day and we brought some desserts back to the room to have later with coffee. Becky’s check-on bag came first, mine came about 1 hour later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCobb Salad – grilled chicken breast, bacon, hard boiled egg, romaine, tomatoes, avocado, Roquefort, choice of dressing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShrimp Scampi – angel hair pasta, zucchini, white wine garlic sauce\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 5pm the ship started to leave the dock so we went up to the observation lounge to watch sailaway. The Icon of the seas was docked in front of us and we had a good view of the world’s newest and largest cruise ship – Royal Caribbean Icon of the Seas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of NCL’s terminal shortly after pulling away. The cruise ship on the left side of the photo is an MSC cruise ship and the one on right side of the photo is the Icon of the Seas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyal Caribbean’s Icon of the Seas\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had dinner in the Haven restaurant. I had lobster deviled eggs, soup and a crab cake. Becky had the Shrimp Louie, beet salad and Surf and turf. She didn’t want all the steak, so I ate some of hers. For dessert we split the chocolate cake and each had a scoop of ice cream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLobster Deviled Eggs – mustard, celery, relish, parmesan crisp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShrimp Louie – romaine lettuce, avocado, tomato, piccalili, thousand island dressing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButternut Squash Soup – with duck confit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSea Salt Roasted Beets – whipped goat cheese, crispy speck, pistachios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrab Cakes – pommery mustard sauce, homemade coleslaw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurf and Turf – lobster tail, filet mignon, sauteed spinach, baked potato, bearnaise sauce. The waiters will remove the lobster meat from the shell, which can be tricky\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOMG Caramel Butterscotch Cheesecake – vanilla custard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecadent Chocolate – devil’s fudge cake\n\n\n\n\n\nThe show tonight was called, Beatles Story: Fabulous Tribute Show, history from 1962 to 1966, which was about 20 songs played by four musicians dressed up to look like the Beatles. The show was good and the songs were all their well known hits.\nAfter the show we went to the ship’s gift shops, since they were now open, to look for something to buy with our non-refundable on board credit. We will probably buy a bottle of rum if we can’t find anything else to spend the money on.\nMaking it to the ship on embarkation day is crucial since the opportunity to join the ship at the first port would be very difficult in this itinerary. Missing a cruise ship is not covered completely by my travel insurance. The travel insurance I have will cover trip delay and interruption for up to $500 per day for actual expenses incurred, and not reimbursement for the cost of a cruise if you miss the ship."

    "text": "Sunday: at sea\nThe ship’s location at daybreak was off the coast of western Cuba.\nI got up early, made a cup of coffee and ate the brownie from the buffet we took yesterday. The skies were clear and the air temperature was about 65F.\nWe had breakfast in the Haven dining room. I had Poached Eggs ‘Meurette’ and Becky had an omelet. I’m working my way down the breakfast menu. After breakfast we went down to the lobby where morning trivia takes place. When we got there, a Sudoku challenge was about to start. The guests participating had 15 minutes to solve the puzzle and about 10 were able to do so. The next event was trivia and Becky and I didn’t join any other teams. We got 10 of 20 questions correct and the high score was 15 out of 20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning coffee and fruit plate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Haven Horizon lounge there is a small buffet. In the morning starting at 6:30 am, fruit, cheese, cold cuts, breads and danishes are available. At about 11am, the selections are changed to small roll ups, cookies, whole fruits, chips and dessert items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coffee machine in the Horizon lounge is very nice. The machine will make Espresso, Café Crème, Cappuccino, Caffè Latte, Espresso Macchiato, Americano, Latte Macchiato. I usually make an Americano with cream and Becky makes a Cappuccino, to which she adds Baileys Irish Cream. I’ve tried the Latte, but it’s too milky for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoached Eggs ‘Meurette’ – grilled country bread, bacon, mushrooms, Bordelaise sauce\n\n\n\n\n\nOvernight, our on-board credit was loaded to our account, so now we could see the exact amount. There were some small charges for tax on drinks served while in the Port of Miami and we had $124 to spend. Since we had time before our next event, we stopped by the gift shops to look around and Becky noticed that they were selling a brand of watches called Swatch, which she likes. She reminded me that I lost a bet a few years ago where I bet her a Swatch that she could not get into the pool because it was so cold; for a Swatch, I found out she could. She found one that she liked for $61 and we used some of the on board credit to make the purchase.\n\n\n\nB- Becky’s new swatch\n\n\nOur first event of the morning was wines around the world wine tasting. This is a free event for Latitude Sapphire and above members. While we were waiting, the Assistant Hotel Director walked by and I said, ‘Hey Trevor’, to get his attention. We know Trevor from previous cruises and from other ships. One of the other guests who was standing nearby asked if we were the other Ambassadors and we said yes; she was also an Ambassador and her name was Lydia. During the wine tasting event, Becky and Lydia talked a lot. Wine tasting on the Joy was conducted differently than other ships, here it was more like a class and less socializing. At the wine event I met Dan who was traveling solo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatitude Wines Around the World, available to Latitude Platinum members and above. Usually four reds and four white wines are available and the countries or regions are the US, South America (Argentina and Peru) and France. On the Joy, the servers bring the wines to you and give you small pours. On other ships, like the Bliss, the guests go from station to station and can drink as much as they want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSail & Sustain Mixology Experience – Eight shots of various sweet concoctions are poured while the mixologist explains what they are. I really only like two of them. We usually skip this event, which is available to Latitude Diamond members and above. The reason we usually skip the event is that it’s held at one of the outside bars, which can be windy or hot; and the time of the event often interferes with other activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had lunch in our room, which was BLT sandwiches from room service. We also stopped by the Haven lounge and took two plates of various food back to our room.\nAt 1pm we attended the Latitudes party. A table was reserved for the Ambassadors, which was nice. Dan also joined us at our table. The Latitude party is more or less a short sales presentation for what Norwegian calls their Cruise Next Program, where you can put a deposit down on a future cruise and receive cash back in the form of non-refundable credit.\nAt 2pm we attended the Mixology event, which is free for Latitude Diamond members and above. This was held outside at the Mojito Bar. The weather was sunny and not too windy or hot. We sometimes skip this event since we don’t care for the drinks served at the event. Lydia, Becky and I were the only ones who attended.\nAround 5pm the captain made an announcement about stopping for a fishing vessel that looked like a small raft. The occupants said that they were just fishermen and didn’t need assistance.\nAt 6pm we attended the Captain’s VIP party, which we always attend. Sometimes the party is very crowded, but this evening not so much. The drinks and Horderves are usually very good. Lydia was also at the party. Suite guests and Latitude Ambassadors are invited to the Captains VIP party. Lydia is staying in a regular balcony cabin, but she is a brand new Ambassador.\nAfter the party we had dinner in the Haven restaurant. I had the Pan Seared Steelhead Trout, not so good this time – under cooked in the middle, and Becky had one crab cake and a lobster tail. Becky didn’t like her crab cake and gave it to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlow Roasted Pork Belly - Sweet Potato, Granny Smith Apple, Piquillo Pepper Coulis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPan Seared Steelhead Trout – beluga lentils, sauteed broccolini, vierge sauce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky’s dinner - one crab cake and one lobster tail"

Breakfast was avocado toast for me and Becky had french toast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky’s breakfast - French toast with ham on the side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvocado Toast – poached egg, feta, multi grain bread\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ship docked at Roatán, Honduras around 9am. As we left the ship it was lightly raining, but not enough to make us put up our umbrellas. There is ongoing construction at the port area and we wanted to see what was new. That took about 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding murals in the Port of Roatan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of the Joy from shore side. In the background, a Viking Ocean cruise ship was also in port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Port of Roatan from Haven sun deck.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spent the remainder of the morning at the sun deck, then went to swim in the pool, but it was very cold and I could only stay in for a minute.\nLunch was in the Haven restaurant and we had the fish sandwich with no bun. The fish seemed a bit undercooked, so I just ate around the edges. Becky also had a Ceasar Salad and we ordered the mushroom flatbread to share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSesame Crusted Fish Sandwich – pickled ginger slaw, wasabi mayonnaise, golden french fries w/o the bun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaesar Salad - Romaine Lettuce, Parmesan Cheese, Garlic Croutons, Anchovies, Caesar Dressing.

You are given a category and a letter. Then you think of a matching word, the next word then needs to start with the last letter of the first word and also match the category. You get one point for every word.\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon, our butler delivered a plate of Cruditees - Raw and Marinated Vegetables, Creamy Dipping Sauce.\n\n\nOur dinner tonight was at the French restaurant called Le Bistro. I had Coq au Vin and Becky had the Lamb chops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoq Au Vin - Red Wine-Braised Chicken, Mushrooms, Potatoes, Pearl Onion, Bacon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky’s dinner: Carré d’Agneau Rôti et Souris d’Agneau aux Saveurs Marocaines - Braised Shank and Roasted Lamb Chop, Moroccan Spices, Dried Fruits, Sweet Potatoes, Cilantro\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter dinner we went to the comedy show, which was so-so. The show was PG-13 and mainly parity songs with some bathroom humor.\nFor our night cap, I had a brandy on the rocks and Becky had a Carajillo, which is an espresso liquor; she didn’t like it too much."

    "text": "Tuesday: Harvest Caye, Belize\n\n\n\nSun rise on the way to Belize\n\n\nToday’s port was Harvest Caye in Belize, which is NCL’s “private island”. I woke early, made coffee and did some work on my laptop. We ordered room service breakfast for delivery at 7am. By 8am the ship had been cleared and we went ashore. The skies were partly cloudy and the temperature was about 80F. On the island, there are shops, restaurants, bars and a small zoo called the Wildlife Experience. The most interesting thing in the Wildlife Experience is the butterfly cage. There were two types of butterflies, one with blue wings and another called the Owl Face (or something like that).\n\n\n\nHarvest Caye from Haven sun deck\n\n\nThere is a very nice pool on the island and we spent about two hours lazing on the lounge chairs by the pool. When we arrived, not too many people were there and we had our pick of lounge chairs and umbrellas in the shade. The water felt cold and when the sun went behind a cloud it was a little chilly. The food and drink on the island is not included in the cruise fare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCats and carvings for sale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LightHouse, which is the launching point for the zip line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pool on Harvest Caye\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChairs lined up on the beach.

We sat on the pool mezzanine, ordered lunch and drank a beer. Before going back to the room, we ordered a carrot cake from the lunch menu to be our dessert for dinner. If you let the restaurant know before lunch service ends, most items on the lunch menu can be served for dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaven pool with roof open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaven sun deck, an exclusive area for Haven guests and much less crowded than the main pool deck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIce Cream Sandwiches – sable cookies with vanilla and chocolate, shredded coconut, red velvet crumbs. As you can see, the ice cream is starting to melt and these were hard to eat, since the ice cream squished out when you took a bite of the sandwich\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicken Caesar Wrap – chicken breast, romaine, tomato herb tortilla, onion rings and french fries.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were back in our room by 2pm, just in time for some chocolates to be delivered. So we had a piece of chocolate and a cup of coffee. Later I took a nap and at about 4pm the butler delivered cookies and cruditees.\nBefore dinner we had cocktails. Dinner tonight was at the Haven restaurant and I ordered Surf and Turf and Becky ordered Lamb. I gave my lobster to Becky. The lobsters on this cruise are bigger and tastier than on previous cruises, according to Becky. Now they charge $25 for a second lobster. Before you could get at many as you wanted. I’m not a lobster fan, so Becky could have two tails, mine and hers, but so far one is enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomeone ordered a smoked old fashioned and the bartender is giving the drink the smoke treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurf and Turf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPancetta Wrapped Lamb Ribeye - Roasted Potatoes, Green Beans, Rosemary Jus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrot Cake\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter dinner we went to listen to music performed by one of the bands, called ADDA. They were singing mellow country hits, like songs from the Eagles and John Denver. They were very good. We didn’t stay too long since we wanted to watch the show in the main theater; tonight’s show was the Beatles Story – Sgt. Pepper’s. We like some of the Beatles’ music, but not so much from this era. The theater was very full and we sat in the VIP area, something we don’t normally do, since there is a different row that we like better since it has better visibility. During the show, there was a Code Alpha announcement and the band stopped playing for a few minutes. Code Alpha is for a medical emergency somewhere on the ship.\n\n\n\nNCL’s house band performing in the Q SmokeHouse Restaurant.\n\n\nTonight we had to turn the clock forward one hour."

Next on my breakfast line up was the Eggs Benedict. The Joy was the first ship to dock. There was a Carnival and a Royal Caribbean ship also docking at Costa Maya. The winds were strong and there was a large swell at the dock and we could see the water splashing onto the dock sometimes. A few minutes after tying up, the Captain announced that it was not safe to remain at dock and that we would be leaving. We pulled away a few minutes later. Since we missed the port we were refunded $20 in port taxes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassengers purchase rubber ducks, attach tags and hide them in spots around the cruise ship. When we find a duck, we take them home and add them to our small collection of cruise ducks. These are the ones we found so far.

We spent the morning by the pool. Later we had lunch on the outdoor patio. The skies were partly cloudy and the air temperature was about 70F, just perfect for having lunch outdoors. I had a Cobb Salad and Becky had the fish sandwich with no bun. I had some of her fish. The piece of fish is too big for a sandwich.

Dinner tonight was at the Italian restaurant called La Cucina and was complimentary from the Hotel Manager and dinner came with a bottle of wine. I selected a white wine from Spain (Antonio Nadal Ari Goitia Verdejo “the Flyer”, Rueda, Spain). I think it was a white blend and the waiter helped me pick it out. I had the Pollo Cacciatore (chicken simmered in fresh tomatoes, rosemary garlic sauce, peppers and onions) and Becky had the Gamberi Fra Diavolo, basically a shrimp dish which she customized by adding extra shrimp, changing the sauce to one less spicy and holding the pasta; so essentially a plate of shrimp with some spaghetti sauce. For dessert Becky had the Tiramisu and I had the cheesecake. Lydia joined us for dinner.

    "text": "Saturday: disembark\nThe ship arrived in Miami very early and we were alongside the pier by 530am. After showering, we did our final packing and headed up to deck 17 for our final meal on the ship. We both had omelets for breakfast. We skipped the coffee since we would be in exit lines and might not find restrooms until we got to the airport.\nAround 8am we left our room for the final time with all our bags and took the elevator to deck 17 where the Haven lounge is located. Patrick, the concierge, said the three bedroom suite had been vacated so we went up to have a look at the room. The room hadn’t been cleaned yet, and the beds were not made, but it was interesting to see the rooms. It had a dining table for six, a big living room and a very large balcony.\nFrom the Haven lobby, we took a service elevator to deck 7 where we exited the ship. I asked where the confiscated liquor pickup was and I was told that it was back on the ship, which was not what I was told when they took the mini bottles from me.\nCustoms and Border Protection was quick and it’s done with facial recognition. Out on the street I had a hard time getting a cell connection and I switched my mobile connection to LTE from 5G, which seemed to work better. I was able to connect to Lyft and call for a ride. Our Lyft ride arrived in about 5 minutes, a Chevy Silverado pickup truck. It had a crew cab and our luggage fit in the bed of the truck. Our driver didn’t speak any English, but with my limited Spanish and his limited English, we learned that he was from Cuba and arrived in the US two years ago.\nOnce we left the cruise terminal area the traffic was light and we arrived at the airport in no time. We were able to check our bags and go through security. Talked to a Turkish lounge representative who offered us a ride, but we said no, since it was still early and there is a three hour maximum time limit in the lounge. The Turkish lounge is part of the Priority Pass program, which many travel credit cards like American Express Platinum, Capital One Venture X and Chase Sapphire Reserve include as a benefit. “Free” access is nice, but the venues always seem crowded.\nWe waited until about 1030am to check into the lounge. The Turkish Airlines Lounge had gotten good reviews, but when we got there it was extremely crowded and we could not find a seat. After looking around for a few minutes we saw empty seats in the small computer room, so we sat there. At least I can plug in my laptop (while I write this). I had a cup of coffee and later a small sandwich and a beer. Becky had some cookies, coffee and a small chicken sandwich with a glass of wine. There was a waiting line for the bathroom and limited selection of food. Beer, sodas and wine were available in the morning and in the afternoon a self service bar was set up. Overall, probably the worst airport lounge experience because of the crowds and the mediocre food. Good thing it’s kind of free. Not worth the long walk if you are short on time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entrance to the Turkish Airlines Lounge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA small food counter with limited selections: Two kinds of soup, but one was empty; Small sandwiches; cookies etc. Food was available from an online menu and I saw orders of meatballs and humus being delivered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drink counter was small and the coffee machine only served half cups of coffee. Soda, water and two types of beer were in the refrigerators.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter leaving the Turkish Lounge (at 1:48pm), we did some walking around the airport. We still had 5 hours to wait until boarding.\nAt 330pm we had tacos with rice and beans at the Corona Beach House, also a Priority Pass venue. While we were eating the airline announced a gate change, from D10 to D42. The tacos were good and since we didn’t spend the full $60 allowance, there was no bill at the end. This surprised me, since normally there are taxes that are required to be paid; so all we did was leave a tip.\nIt must be spring break time since the airport is full of groups of kids.\nWhen we got tired of sitting we went on walks around the terminal. Terminal D in Miami must be about a mile long and there are 60 gates on the D concourse.\nThe flight from Miami to Los Angeles was 5 hours long. Becky pre-ordered meals for us. I had the chicken breast and Becky had roast beef. Dessert was an ice cream Sundae.\nTwo passengers in first class didn’t make the flight and two coach passengers from the back were moved up to first class, one of them was a pilot.\nWhen we landed it was overcast and there were some showers. Bags from a Maui flight came down the ramp wet. Our bags were only slightly damp. We had a 20 minute wait for the Flyaway bus. The traffic was light for the trip to Van Nuys. After paying for parking, $60, we rolled our bags up to the second level of the parking garage and loaded the car. We were home by 1am, local time. For us we had been up almost 24 hours. From the time the wheels of the plane touched down at LAX to when we arrived home, it took three hours.\nThe trip was nice, but we ate too much. Three big meals in addition to the butler snacks and afternoon snacks, horizon lounge snacks was too much. I wasn’t hungry for dinner sometimes."

    "text": "Pre-Cruise travel – May 27\nToday is our travel day to Vancouver, Canada. Our flight departs at 956am which makes planning the drive through the morning traffic a challenge. Either we get up early to beat some of the traffic, arrive at the airport early and wait in the terminal; or sit in traffic and stress about missing the flight. So we got up early. Nevertheless, I get complaints about getting to the airport too early.\nWe left home around 5 am for the one hour drive to Van Nuys where we parked our car to catch the LAX Flyaway bus to the airport. The Flyaway bus terminal has a nice 5 level parking garage, where I can usually park inside. Sometimes the garage fills up, so I made a reservation about one week prior to our travel day. I chose 6am as my entry time. If I’m early I’ll need to wait.\nThe traffic was light and we arrived at the Van Nuys Flyaway station around 550am. I dropped Becky off at the curb with her luggage and she went inside to wait or get in line for the next bus. At 6am I drove through the parking gate to look for a spot in the garage. I found a spot on the second level and took a picture of my car and the zone that I was parked in. Twenty days from now I won’t have to wonder, where the hell is my car?\nWhen I caught up with Becky, there was a long line for the next bus and I joined her in line. We were on the 620 am bus and we left on time. The traffic was heavy and Google Maps said the ride would take an hour. With no traffic it normally takes about 30 minutes. Once we were south of Sunset Boulevard we started moving a bit faster. It took 52 minutes to go from Van Nuys to LAX terminal 1 and another 15 minutes to arrive at terminal 5. Once inside the terminal, bag check and TSA PreCheck took another 10 minutes. Our gate was really a transfer gate where we would board a bus to a satellite terminal. Since we had a bit of time to spare, I walked to Concourse 6 to pick up some free snacks at the Priority Pass venue. About 40 minutes prior to boarding time we took the transfer bus to the American Eagle terminal, which is on the very east side of the airport.\nAt the checkin counter, my bag weighed 44 pounds and Becky’s weighed 49 pounds. Packing for this trip was more difficult than packing for a trip to the Caribbean or the Mexican Riviera. Cold weather clothes, like jackets, long pants and boots take up more room in the suitcase and are much heavier than tee-shirts and shorts. The long range forecast shows variable weather. Our first day in Vancouver was foretasted to be sunny and almost 80F, while our first port in Klawock is going to be rainy and 50F.\nOur flight today was on an Embraer 175, operated by WestJet, which is an American Airlines’ regional partner. The flight was about 3 hours long and we were served a box lunch and a beverage. The box lunch was good. For our beverages I ordered a G&T and Becky had Jack and Sprite. Becky didn’t like her dessert or the fruit, so I ate them.\n\n\n\nOur in flight meal consisted of a two small breakfast sandwiches (ham and eggs), sliced watermelon, some sort of custard and salad dressing (I didn’t use).\n\n\nAs we flew north I had nice views of Yosemite and Lake Tahoe.\n\n\n\nMt. Rainier from 38,000 ft.\n\n\nThe in-flight movies didn’t look interesting, so I listened to music and read a book on my kindle. The flight was 3 hours from wheels up to touch down.\nCanadian customs and immigration was easy and in no time we were out on the curb waiting for the hotel shuttle to pick us up. We were able to get an early check in since I am an IHG member.\nAfter doing a bit of unpacking we walked across the street to Costco to have a look around. We wanted to look at the wine selection available, but we discovered that this Costco doesn’t sell wine or beer. A quick search on my phone revealed a nearby liquor store. We found some wines that would be acceptable to bring on the cruise and we will purchase these tomorrow.\nWe picked up some food at Burger King for our evening meal which we ate in our room."

My travel insurance would not fully cover a missed cruise since this would be considered a trip delay, reimbursable at $500 maximum per day for actual out of pocket expenses.\n\n\n\nA float plane taking off from the Vancouver Harbor Flight Center.\n\n\nI was up at sunrise, about 5am. The water pressure for the shower was pretty low and the shower head was on tight so I couldn’t remove it and take out the flow restrictor. Becky got up later and I made a cup of coffee and did some work on the laptop while she got ready.\nBreakfast was the typical Holiday Inn Express free hotel breakfast. This morning it was pre-made cheese omelets, bacon and coffee for me. I also had some yogurt and a cinnamon bun. I haven’t had a cinnamon bun in ages and it was good. The coffee and the rest of the breakfast was decent. The only thing I didn’t care for were the sausages since they had kind of a weird mushy consistency.\nAround 930am we walked to the Bridgeport Skytrain station, a 10 minute walk. The weather was sunny and 70F in the morning. It’s a two zone trip to Waterfront Station and I get a dollar off the ticket for being a senior. The train starts at the airport and many of the passengers had luggage with them.\n\n\n\nThe public version of the 2010 Winter Games Olympic Cauldron, located in Jack Poole Plaza. It consists of four, crystal-like “arms” and a central burner.\n\n\nToday there were three cruise ships in port - Holland Zaandam, Regent Seven Seas Explorer and the Coral Princess. There was also a convention being held nearby, so the waterfront was bustling with a lot of people. We explored the shopping district along Granville St. and stopped in at the Cathedral of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary. Mass was being held and from the back of the church we watched the ending of mass. After a bit more window shopping we walked to the GasTown district for lunch.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCathedral Square. Facing the Holy Rosary Cathedral, this square is filled with magnolias and ginkgo trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCathedral of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe end of mass at the Cathedral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVancouver’s Gastown Steam Clock, built in 1977. The clock is powered by steam and whistles to tell the time. The world’s first steam powered clock. Steam power winds the weights and blows the whistles. Every 4.5 minutes one steel weight will travel by steam power to the top of the clock. Each quarter hour the clock will sound the Westminster chimes. The large whistle will sound once an hour. The steam is supplied by the underground system of central heat distributors.\n\n\nWe had a late lunch at a place called the SteamWorks Brewing Co., we both had burgers and beers. The food was good. After lunch we boarded the Skytrain back to the Bridgeport station in Richmond.\n\n\n\nMy lunch today was the Brewhouse Burger - smoked cheddar, crispy onion ring, bourbon bacon jam, lettuce, tomato, bbq sauce, dijon-mayo.\n\n\nNear the station we bought three bottles of budget wine at a liquor store, which we will take onto the cruise ship. We can bring up to six on the ship. Two bottles are to drink in the room and we plan to bring one bottle to dinner, for which we will be charged a $25 corkage fee. We don’t have the beverage package, so this cruise is BYOB. More on that later.\nWe did a lot of walking today. My fitbit reported that I took 16,214 steps and walked 7.69 miles."

    "text": "Embarkation – May 29\nToday is embarkation day. I woke early, took my shower and made a cup of coffee. Breakfast was scrambled eggs, bacon, potatoes and a second cup of coffee. The weather outside was overcast and raining, foretasted to clear up in the afternoon.\n\n\n\nCanada place: Built to look like a ship, this complex houses a convention center, hotel and ferry terminal.\n\n\nWe spent the morning packing and organizing our stuff for the trip to the cruise port. We were assigned an 1130am check in time. So I was keeping an eye on the traffic to gauge our travel time. At 10am I called for a Lyft car to pick us up and he was waiting at the hotel entrance when we came down stairs. The morning traffic was heavy and the trip took about 40 minutes. At the terminal, the attendant asked which cruise ship we were on and directed us to the correct location for passenger drop off. We had a 20 foot walk with our bags from the car to the luggage drop off point and only about three other passengers were there. We had some carry-on bags with us and a short elevator ride up two levels brought us to the check in line.\nToday there were three cruise ships at the Canada Place terminal - the Riviera (1250 passengers, 800 crew), the Roald Amundsen (532 passengers, 175 crew) and the Silver Moon (596 passengers, 411 crew). Only Riviera passengers were boarding. No one was in the lines for the other ships. At 11am the line for the Riviera started to move and there were about 200 people in front of us. The line moved quickly and in about 30 minutes we had checked in, went through the metal detectors, had our carryon x-rayed and were on the ship.\n\n\n\nOceania Riviera check in line. Only passengers for the Riviera were checking when we were in line.\n\n\nOur ship is the Oceania Riviera and is part of Oceania Cruise Lines which is owned by Norwegian Cruise Lines. Oceania is considered a luxury cruise line and claims to have “The Finest Cuisine at Sea”. The Riviera was the second ship that Oceania built and the sixth ship in its fleet, at the time. The Riviera entered service in 2012 and was last refurbished in 2022. She has 625 staterooms which can hold 1250 guests (double occupancy) and has a crew of 800. With a displacement of 66,172 gross tons, she is a small ship by today’s Mega Ship standards.\nOur cruise on the Riviera is called - Wilds Of Alaska, and is a 12 day cruise starting in Vancouver Canada and ending in Whittier, Alaska. We booked this cruise back in November of 2024 and made final payment in December. We normally monitor the web page for any sales or special offers; and prior to final payment we did get a substantial price reduction. Oceania is not very flexible once final payment was made and we missed out on additional offers. Oceania is having trouble selling out this cruise because there were still many cabins available the week prior to sailing.\n\n\n\nOceania called this itinerary, Wilds of Alaska, a 12 night cruise starting in Vancouver and ending in Whittier.\n\n\nOn this cruise we get unlimited slow WiFi and $250 of onboard credit. We will use the onboard credit to buy drinks since we didn’t get the beverage package. The free beverage package was one of the promotional offers we missed out on. We could use our credit to make a down payment on a beverage package, but we would need to drink more than we usually do just to break even.\n\n\n\nA string quartet played a selection of classical music in the atrium on the first day.\n\n\nAfter boarding, we stopped by the restaurant reservation desk and made a 630pm reservation for two (no sharing) at Red Ginger, the Asian Fusion themed restaurant. We made our reservations for the other specialty restaurants about two and half months ago - as soon as the window opened. We were able to get the restaurants, times and tables we wanted. I think this is probably the only negative aspect of cruising on a small ship - that restaurant reservations are limited, and without priority, you will be sharing a table or eating very late. Some people like eating with strangers, but I prefer eating alone with Becky or with people we know.\nWe picked up question sheets for the Art Scavenger Hunt. This ship has a lot of original art. We will get a lot of Big-O points for completing the challenge, which can be turned in at the end of the cruise for merchandise. We have saved about 50 Big-O points from our last cruise, which we plan to redeem if there is a jacket in Becky’s size.\n\n\n\nThe first page of the Art Scavenger Hunt answer sheet. There are 60 items we need to locate. We carried one of these sheets around for the first few days as we worked on locating all the items and getting hints from other guests.\n\n\nWe dropped our carry-on bags in our room, which was not ready yet, but looked clean and made up and went to the Wave Grill for lunch. The Waves Grill is a casual alfresco dining venue located near the pool in a shaded area. I ordered a Cuban Sandwich - slow-roasted marinated pork, ham, swiss, dill pickles, mustard, grilled Cuban bread, mojo sauce and a side of sweet potato fries. The sandwich was good, I’ve had it on previous cruises and I was looking forward to having another one. Becky ordered a shrimp sandwich without the bread and a small plate of pork ribs. While waiting for our orders, Becky went to the Terrace Café (buffet), which was just a few steps away, to get a bowl of clam chowder. For dessert I had a scoop of strawberry ice cream. Then we went to Baristas, the ship’s coffee bar, for a latte and some cookies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky ordered the shrimp sandwich without the bun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPork ribs and clam chowder.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spent the afternoon exploring the ship and looking at the art. Later we met our butler, Rohit, from India, who has a thick accent and very hard to understand, and our stateroom attendant, Jingle, from the Philippines.\n\n\n\nSailing out of Vancouver Harbor. A view of the Lions Gate Bridge which was opened in 1938 and connects the City of Vancouver to the North Shore municipalities. The term “Lions Gate” refers to the Lions, a pair of mountain peaks north of Vancouver. A pair of cast concrete lions, designed by sculptor Charles Marega, were placed on either side of the south approach to the bridge in January 1939.\n\n\nDinner at Red Ginger was a little disappointing. The food was just OK. We have had much better Asian food on other ships. We have a reservation at the same restaurant towards the end of the cruise and we will see if we can secure a reservation at one of the other restaurants as a replacement.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVietnamese Pork Spring Roll and sweet & sour fish sauce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaramelized Tiger Prawns, onions, chili-garlic sauce, scallions. Becky asked for no red pepper flakes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVietnamese Chicken Salad - shredded chicken, cabbage, carrots, onions, sweet chili sauce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAsian Greens - mixed greens, peanut dressing.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMiso-Glazed Sea Bass, den miso, hoba leaf. The dish was not that good. The sea bass was mushy and the sauce overpowered the fish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven Spice-Crusted Lamb Rack - fresh wasabi-lamb jus, shiitake mushrooms, snow peas. Becky didn’t care for the taste of the lamb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrème Brûlée - chocolate, lemongrass. The taste was a bit off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSoft Ice Cream - Japanese togarashi, chili salt. My second dessert. A very unusual combination of ice cream, chili pepper and salt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky’s dessert: Bounty Cake - coconut, chocolate chips, vanilla bean.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe show tonight was called Broadway in Concert, and was a melody of various songs from Broadway. The singers were good, but most of the songs we had not heard before.\nTonight the ship’s clocks get turned back one hour to put us on Alaska time."

    "text": "Sea Day – May 30\nI woke early, took my shower, got dressed and went to get some coffee. My first stop was the executive lounge. I didn’t stay long because it was crowded and the place didn’t have a good spot to work on my computer or any windows. So I went to the Horizon Lounge on deck 15. I found a spot by the window, got my coffee and settled in. The weather was overcast with some showers and windy. I happened to see a whale spout off in the distance. After Becky was ready we went for coffee at Baristas, the ship’s coffee bar. It was a busy place. We had breakfast in the main dining room; we both had omelets.\n\n\n\nBecky ordered an omelet and lamb chops for her breakfast.\n\n\nDuring the morning we continued to work on the art scavenger hunt. We met other passengers doing the scavenger hut and compared answers. The other morning activity was Oceania’s version of indoor Bocce Ball, which took about 2 minutes and we earned four Big-O points. The way the game is played is that one player rolls a white ball about 10 feet down the carpet and two players, each with four balls, attempt to roll their balls so that they come as close as possible to the white ball.\nWe had lunch in the main dining room. I had the chef’s special which was a taste of Mexico, the theme in the buffet today. This dish consisted of small samples of various entries, like tacos, beef in mole sauce, ceviche, etc. about six samples.\n\n\n\nMy selection for lunch, the chef’s special, a taste of Mexico.\n\n\nAt 2pm, there was a Big-O points activity called Top Toss. This event consisted of tossing a bolo, which is a string connecting two balls, and trying to get the bolo to loop around one of three horizontal bars. We earned four Bi-O points for this activity.\nAt 4pm afternoon tea was served. Oceania puts on the best high tea that we have ever had at sea. We each had a little sandwich and a sweet bite. There was a string quartet playing classical tunes.\n\n\n\nAfternoon tea selections.\n\n\n5pm Canapes arrived and we made drinks in our room. I had a Gin and Tonic and Becky had a whiskey and Sprite.\n\n\n\nAfternoon canapes, I ordered California rolls and Becky got crackers, mini-pita with hummus, salsa and tzatziki.\n\n\nDinner tonight was in the main dining room and lobster was served. I’m not a fan of lobster, so I had the salmon. Becky said the lobster was good and I tried a few bites and I agreed, it was good. Since it was Lobster Night, we went to the buffet and Becky got a grilled lobster tail. I had a cup of coffee and some ice cream.\nThe show tonight was a comedy and the comedian told jokes and funny stories somewhat related to things his Dad used to say. I thought it was OK, but Becky was bored and nodded off during the show. One guest, who was sitting in the front row, was also sleeping during the performance and the comedian proceeded to roast him. That was kind of funny and the guest must have gotten a bit upset, because the roasting continued about him being upset."

    "text": "Klawock – May 31\nToday’s port is the small city of Klawock located on the west coast of Prince of Wales Island in Southeast Alaska. The city is located about 56 miles west of Ketchikan as the crow flies.\nAfter completing our morning routine of coffee, breakfast and bocce ball, we boarded one of the ship’s tenders for the short ride to shore. The Klawock cruise ship port opened in 2024. The port is actually just a small dock and a large gravel parking lot. The facility is owned and operated by Tlingit companies. The passenger terminal area consists of a small dock, a large tent and a yurt that houses a coffee shop. Inside the tent is a waiting area for tours and some information booths. Many of the tours had not departed and there was a long line for the shuttle bus to town.\n\n\n\nPoached egg on avocado toast with a side a pork sausage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Riviera conducting tender operations.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCruise ship tender dock.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter standing inline a bit and not seeing any shuttle buses, Becky went to talk to one of the guides while I held our place in line. We decided to walk to town, only 2 miles away along mostly flat terrain. The weather forecast called for a break in the rain and it did look like the weather was improving. Walking behind us were several other couples who decided to follow our lead and walk to town. After a 20 minute walk, mostly along a gravel road and past a lumber mill, we arrived at the edge of town.\nOne of Klawock’s most significant attractions is the Klawock Totem Park, which has the largest collection of authentic totem poles in Alaska. All the totem poles looked new. While we were there, several tour groups also stopped and we could overhear the narration about the totem poles. Just as we were about to leave the totem pole park, the shuttle bus came by and we hopped on for a ride back to the cruise terminal. We had planned to see a small church and the cultural center, but given that the shuttle had just arrived and judging by the looks of what we saw of the town, we decided to skip the rest of planned stops and return to the ship. The shuttle bus first took us to the nearby town of Craig before heading to the ship. Along the way the driver provided comments about life in this part of Alaska and the attractions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the totem poles and the town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTour groups at the totem pole park.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack on board, we went to the spa to soak in the hot tub and use the sauna. The hot tub wasn’t that warm so we didn’t stay too long. Becky went back to our room to get ready for afternoon tea and I stayed to sit in the dry sauna for about 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAt tea time a cart with the day’s selection of small sandwiches and sweets is wheeled to each table and you can make your selections. We would usually get a sandwich and something sweet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy selections for tea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky’s selection for tea.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe captain’s party was rescheduled to take place today; it was originally scheduled for yesterday, but postponed on account of the rough seas. The rocking and rolling wasn’t that bad, but delaying the party was probably a good idea since many of the passengers are older. Since the drinks are free, the party was very well attended. We left the party early because we had dinner reservations.\nDinner tonight was at Jocques, the french themed restaurant. The food was excellent and we had a table for two next to the window where we could see the islands as we passed by. I would say that our dining experience tonight did qualify as the “Finest Dining at Sea”. Becky had the Herb-Roasted Lamb Rack and I had the Filet Mignon with seared Foie Gras and Truffle Sauce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDinner tonight was at Jacques, the French restaurant.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe salt cellar at our table.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are called Provencal Tartlet of the day and Saint-Nectaire Choux, according to the menu, and were served before we ordered our food.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalade de Crabe au Raifort et Sauce à l’Orange Sanguine - Lump Crab Meat Salad, Horseradish, Blood Orange Sauce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrème de Potiron - Creamy Pumpkin Soup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilet de Bœuf Rossini - Filet Mignon, Seared Foie Gras, Truffle Sauce.

    "text": "Ketchikan – June 1\nToday’s port is Ketchikan and the Riviera docked at Ward Cove, about 8 miles from the center of town. Free buses were provided and at 830am we were on the bus heading towards town. As we were walking to the bus, the Carnival Legend was just pulling into the dock opposite the Riviera. Ward Cove can accommodate two cruise ships. There are five cruise ships scheduled to dock within walking distance to town. So there are a total of seven ships docked in Ketchikan today with a passenger count exceeding the town’s population. The bus ride to town took about 20 minutes and the driver provided a nice narration which made the trip go by faster. The weather today was mostly cloudy and a bit chilly in the morning, but it warmed to the upper 50’s by noon; and the sunshine made it seem warmer.\n\n\n\nA selfie with the Welcome to Ketchikan Sign.\n\n\nThe plan for today was to explore the town on foot, do some window shopping, visit the Discovery Center and Creek Street. The town was very busy with all the cruise passengers. Most of the shops don’t sell anything we are interested in. One thing that did surprise me was all the restaurants were packed, presumably with cruise passengers who didn’t get enough food on the ship.\n\n\n\nOne of Ketchikan’s many totem poles.\n\n\nWe stopped into the Southeast Alaska Discovery Center, which is run by the US Forest Service. This is Alaska’s Public Lands Information Center, the only one in Southeast Alaska. It has 20,000 square feet of exhibits highlighting the beauty, diversity and history of Alaska’s temperate rainforest. Entrance to the center is free with a National Park Pass, otherwise not really worth the $5 entrance fee. We watched a nice informative movie and wandered about looking at the exhibits. Perhaps the most important feature to one of us were the clean bathrooms.\nCreek Street was very busy and looked the same as I remember from past visits. On the way back to the bus we stopped into a convenience store and bought a couple of cans of locally brewed beer to have in our room. By noon we were back on the bus going back to the ship.\n\n\n\nHistoric Creek Street. The street is actually a boardwalk mounted in stilts on a high slope on the east side of Ketchikan Creek, east of the city’s downtown. Creek Street is infamous as being Ketchikan’s red light district, roughly between 1903 and 1954, and some of its attractions are commemorations of this past. Its origins lie in a 1903 city ordinance banishing brothels from the city center to the “Indian Town” area on the east side of the creek, and it operated until the brothels were outlawed and shut down in 1954.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dock at Ward Cove as the Riviera was leaving. The Carnival Legend would stay for another hour. Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings developed the Ward Cove cruise port in partnership with Ward Cove Dock Group. It was built on a former pulp mill site and designed to accommodate Norwegian’s large Breakaway class vessels. The terminal opened in 2021 and while there are excursions from the port, the distance to downtown has frustrated some visitors.\n\n\nFor lunch we ordered room service sandwiches and a bowl of potato chips. In the afternoon, we continued to work on the Art Scavenger Hunt; we are looking for seven answers. Becky finished a movie and later we went to happy hour at Martini’s to order two for one drinks.\n\n\n\nHappy hour, these martinis are called Metropolitans - Vodka, Cointreau, Chambord and Lemon Juice.\n\n\nHappy hour runs from 5 to 6pm. Oceania’s basic beverage package, called the House Select package (beer or wine at lunch and dinner) was not included in our fare at the time we booked the cruise. Oceania also offers an upgraded beverage package called the Prestige Select package ($69.95 per day per person), which includes unlimited premium spirits, cocktails, wine, and beer. It would be difficult for us to drink enough to break even under the Prestige Select package. Martinis ordered at happy hour are $16.20 for two. The only limitation is that the drinks must be the same. Since Becky prefers the fruiter drinks, I let her choose the martinis. Otherwise, I would order a traditional vodka or gin martini.\nFor dinner we dined in-suite. Earlier in the day we arranged to have dinner in our room with food from The Polo Grill, the steak house themed restaurant. Our butler will serve the food course by course or all at once, so we asked the food to be served in two courses, appetizers and starters first, followed by the main course with dessert. We each had a glass of wine from the bottles we had purchased in Vancouver. It was nice to enjoy the food, wine and views of the small islands and Alaskan coast as we sailed to our next port.\n\n\n\nDinner with a view. Main course – I had the Roasted Organic Free-Range Chicken, alderwood smoked. Becky ordered the Grilled Shrimp with roasted vegetables.\n\n\nI overheard a passenger talking about the aurora and that it should be visible after the sunset. So I looked it up online, and sure enough the NOAA prediction for aurora visibility is highly likely. Unfortunately, it was overcast so we didn’t see anything. For the rest of the cruise I’ll keep an eye out for some clear weather after dark."

    "text": "Wrangell – June 2\nToday’s port is Wrangell. The ship was docked by 8am and passengers were walking ashore by 830am. The weather was overcast and 50F, with no rain or wind. The town is located on the northern tip of Wrangell Island and is 155 miles south of Juneau. The town is named after the island, which was named after Ferdinand Petrovich Wrangel, a Russian explorer and the administrator of the Russian-American Company from 1830 to 1835. As of the 2020 census the population was 2,127.\n\n\n\nMain street in the town of Wrangell.\n\n\nOur self guided walking tour of the town included stops at the visitor’s center, a totem pole carving center, the local thrift shop and the city market. We walked about a mile to the petroglyph State Park. Over 40 petroglyphs are visible on the rocks at low tide, which can provide a glimpse into the artistic expressions of the early inhabitants of the area. The date of the petroglyphs hasn’t been determined, but the site itself is about 8,000 years old. There were about three tour groups at the beach and one of the guides who had a loud voice which could be heard from a distance away was providing her group a very extensive narration of the history and age of the petroglyphs, which was very informative.\n\n\n\nAt totem pole carver working on some new poles at the Wrangell Cooperative Association Cultural Center and Carving Shed.\n\n\n\n\n\nA tour group at the Petroglyph Beach State Historic Site.\n\n\n\n\n\nAn example of one of the many petroglyphs.\n\n\nWe were back aboard in time for lunch. Lamb kabobs, ribs and Indian food were being served in the buffet, which sounded good. After lunch we went to the spa to soak in the hot tub, the water temperature was warmer today. Becky went back to the room to get ready and I went to the steam room to relax and rehydrate my skin. The ship’s air conditioning is making my skin dry and chapping my lips. Also, many areas of the ship are cold and sitting in the steam sauna for about 15 minutes warmed me to the core.\n\n\n\nThe Big “O” Martini - Grey Goose L’Orange, Cointreau, Orange Juice, Cranberry Juice and Lime Juice.\n\n\nLater in the day the Captain made an announcement about our schedule for tomorrow. He said the passengers have been using too much water and that it was necessary for the ship to divert to the open ocean to dump the holding tanks, since discharging the waste water tanks is not allowed along the coast of Alaska. So we would be delayed by two hours at our next port. We have been cruising the coastal waterways for the past four days and have five more days in the coastal waters. So I doubt that “the passengers have been using too much water”. I think the ship simply cannot store more than four or five days of wastewater in their holding tanks and at some point the ship would need to discharge the tanks. This particular itinerary prevents them from doing that on a more regular basis. Anyway, that’s my analysis.\nAt 5pm we went to happy hour to order a pair of Martinis at Martinis. Dinner tonight was in the main dining room. We attended the show tonight, which was a medley of songs and performances from the musicals of the 40’s to the 60’s. The show turned out to be kind of a sleeper and I nodded off throughout the performance."

    "text": "Icy Strait Point – June 3\n\n\n\nMorning coffee at Baristas, the coffee shop.\n\n\nToday’s port was Icy Strait Point, which is a cruise destination located on Chichagof Island, about 35 miles west of Juneau and named after the nearby Icy Strait. The port was established in 1996 by the Alaskan Native Huna Totem Corporation and it is the only privately-owned cruise destination in Alaska. The port is built at the site of a restored 1912 Alaskan salmon cannery. The cannery now houses a museum, local arts and crafts shops, and restaurants.\nThe Riviera anchored a short distance off shore and we took tenders ashore. Around 11am we went to the theater to wait for the next tender. The ride to shore took about 5 minutes and by 1130am we were on the gondola that takes passengers from one side of the port to the other. There was one other cruise ship in port during the morning with more arriving later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTender tickets.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe gondola ride from the dock to the cannery for those passengers not wanting to walk the trail.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGondola ride through the trees.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe hiked the short tail from the cannery back to the dock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the attractions at Icy Strait Point is the zip line.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Riviera was in port from 10am to about 10pm, way more than enough time to see and do everything. It only took us about an hour to wander around the shops and visit the museum. By 130pm we were back onboard.\nWe ordered room service for lunch and then went to the spa to sit in the hot tub and then the steam room. Later, I took a nap.\nDinner tonight was at the Polo Grill, which is a steak house themed restaurant. We had a nice table for two next to the window. We each had a glass of wine from the bottle of the budget red wine we had purchased in Vancouver. I wasn’t expecting the wine to be anything great, but it was surprisingly good. The corkage fee of $25 plus the price of the bottle, about $8 US, is about the same as Oceania charges for two glasses of their wine by the glass ($16 plus 20% for each glass). Becky ordered steak and lobster and I had the Filet Mignon. We shared a seven layer chocolate cake for dessert. Overall, a very nice dining experience.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDrinking our budget wine with my starter of Apple Cider Marinated, Slow-Roasted Pork Belly with honey soy sauce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur table at the Polo Grill. We arrived about five minutes before the doors opened and we were the first to be seated at a nice table by the back windows.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter dinner we listened to Abba hits at the Abba mania dance party."

    "text": "Haines – June 4\nToday we are in Haines, Alaska, which is in the northern part of the Alaska Panhandle and nestled along America’s longest fjord, the Lynn Canal. As of the 2020 census, the population of Haines was 1,657. The weather today was overcast, windy and 50F. Rain was forecasted to start around noon, but it didn’t start until after 8pm.\n\n\n\nThe baristas at work in the morning making Espresso, Ristretto, Macchiato, Cappuccino, Latte, Americano, Tea, Café Mélange, Frozen Coffee Crema and other items.\n\n\nThe Roald Amundsen, a small expedition cruise ship operated by the Norwegian company Hurtigruten was also in port. They were tendering their passengers ashore. The Riviera was docked, which makes for easy on and off.\nWe left the ship around 11am to start our DIY walking tour of the town. We went to see some totem poles and a few other spots in town. Near the cruise ship pier is Fort William H. Seward, the first permanent U.S. Army post in Alaska, was built south of Haines in 1904. We walked the loop around the parade grounds to look at the historic buildings.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of Haines and the cruise ship dock.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHistoric houses at Fort William H. Seward. These are now private homes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Riviera docked in Haines.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe returned to the ship in the early afternoon and ordered room service for lunch. Then we went to the spa to soak in the hot tub and steam sauna.\nAt 4pm we attended afternoon tea. Dinner tonight was at Tuscana, the Italian themed restaurant. Dinner was good and we had a nice table by the window. We usually line up for dinner about 10 minutes before the doors open to be the first or second ones seated. Tonight I had the Mediterranean sea bass and Becky had the lobster in pasta.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTonight’s martini was the Peartini - Grey Goose La Poire, Agave Syrup, Disaronno Amaretto and Lemon Juice.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMy main: Branzino Del Mediterraneo Con Verdurine Alla Griglia, In Salsa Di Capperi E Limone - Mediterranean sea bass, fennel-saffron, capers, Piedmont hazelnuts, lemon confit, herb salad.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky’s main: Aragosta Fra Diavolo Con Tagliolini - Maine lobster, tagliolini, garlic, chili peppers, Italian parsley, tomato sauce.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe show tonight was titled, Divas Hits, by an English singer named Alison Ward. We had trouble staying awake."

Some of the art is what I would consider classical or traditional abstract, but much of the collection included some bizarre pieces. One lady said to Becky, “the art on the ship is just terrible.” I didn’t think it was terrible, just very strange in many cases.\nHere are some samples of the art."

    "text": "Photos from Around the Ship\nHere is a collection of photos taken in the various public spaces around the ship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArtist Loft: I think the classes were free, first come first serve, and the classes were every day. Throughout the cruise passengers painted or sketched from travel photos. The instructor provided the materials and encouragement. The classes looked well attended. I didn’t think I could devote enough time during the cruise to finish a project. Maybe next time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRiviera’s main theater.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLibrary has plenty of books and fake fireplaces. The book cabinets are unlocked and guests are on the honor system to return books at the end of the cruise.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is a self service laundry room on each deck 7 through 11. I was told by one of the guests that some of machines are not working and drying takes twice as long was washing, causing a backup for the dryers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Grand Bar lobby. In the evening the string quartet would play here. Otherwise, this area connected the main dining room with the ship’s atrium.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTables in the buffet. Usually only the window tables were busy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe executive lounge. Your room key card is required to access this room. The only reason I didn’t use this room that often was that there were no windows.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe executive lounge: The TV was always on, which was kind of annoying.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coffee bar in the executive lounge.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe atrium main staircase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe main dining room. We usually ate breakfast here most days. On sea days, lunch is also served here. We never saw anyone seated in the center sections.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the seating areas in the main dining room. As you can see some of the tables are very close together.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Horizon Lounge: There is ample window seating and coffee/snacks are available from about 5am to 4pm. This is where I would have my morning coffee while Becky was getting ready in the morning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ship’s Boutiques: Duty-free merchandise such as jewelry, watches, fragrances and Oceania Cruises logo wear is available for sale.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWaves Grill kitchen and salad bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlfresco dining tables at Waves Grill. This area is covered and on cold days it was OK to sit out here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nComputer room: A complimentary login per guest was provided with a maximum of two free logins per suite or stateroom. Starlink has been installed on all ships and provided all guests with slow-speed, unlimited internet included as part of the cruise fare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCasino Bar.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the pool deck seating areas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis sun deck is reserved for suite and concierge class guests. Since this cruise was a cold weather cruise, this was the only time I saw the lounge chairs set up. The raised hot pool is visible in the background. Becky and I came out here on most days and we usually only stayed for about 15 minutes. Having access to this area was a nice perk.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dining room for Toscana.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of the main pool.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe deck loungers around the main pool all have terry cloth covers and a pool towel, something you don’t see on the other cruise lines.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHorizon lounge set up for 4pm tea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn addition to the sandwich and sweet cart, scones are also available with whipped and clotted cream (clotted cream is a traditional English cream topping enjoyed on scones in tea rooms). There were two types of scones and they were excellent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSitting by the window on a rainy day, sailing past tree covered islands and snow capped mountains, listening to a string quartet play classical tunes and enjoying the day’s selection of tea – is just my cup of tea!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRed Ginger’s dining room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPolo Grill’s dining room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ship’s game room.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPart of the ship’s casino.

    "text": "Becky and I are spending a week in Nuevo Vallarta. Nuevo Vallarta is located 20 minutes north of Puerto Vallarta’s International Airport.\nWe had a noon flight to Puerto Vallarta so we didn’t have to get up too early. Traffic on the way to Van Nuys was light and we got to the Flyaways bus terminal in about 50 minutes. I dropped Becky off with her bags at the terminal and then pulled the car around to look for a parking spot in the garage. There was a sign at the gate that said “parking available on the 5th floor”, which I thought was kind of strange because I’d never seen a sign like that before. The parking garage was very full and after looking around on the ground level as well as on floor two through four, I finally made my way up to the fifth floor, which is essentially the roof of the building. So the old Honda is going to spend the week out in the sun, kind of like what I have planned for myself.\nWe were able to catch the 9 a.m. bus to the airport. The bus was pretty empty with maybe only 10 people on it. Traffic from Van Nuys to the airport was light and we made it to the airport in about 25 minutes. At the airport it was extremely crowded with lots of cars and it took forever for the bus to make stops at the terminals to drop people off. It took about another 30 minutes for us to make it to the Alaska terminal which is terminal six.\nThere were about 10 people online at the bag-check counter and the line was going really really slow. I was getting worried that we were going to run out of time because bags needed to be checked one hour before departure and we only had like an hour and a half. The line did end up moving little by little and by the time we got to the counter it was probably 20 minutes later.\nWe stopped by a shop in the terminal called Gameway to pick up two sodas and two small snacks. The snacks we got were a small bag of peanut M&Ms. We can get these for “free” since this is a benefit provided by Chase Sapphire Reserve. We will have these later in the week.\nWe had an hour until boarding time since the flight was delayed by 15 minutes. When we boarded the airplane we were offered a choice of water or champagne. We both got champagne; about three sips from a paper cup, but still kind of nice. After takeoff we ordered our drinks. Becky had a margarita and I had an Old Fashioned and the drinks were served with a cup of warmed up assorted nuts.\nAbout a week before our flight we pre-ordered our meals. Becky’s choice was chicken, potatoes and white beans and the dessert was a chocolate chip cookie. Becky’s dinner drink was Sprite and Jack Daniels. After dinner Becky had the chocolate chip cookie with coffee and Bailey’s. I ordered a hamburger which was OK, not the best, and came with a small bag of potato chips and a chocolate chip cookie. I had a glass of red wine with my meal.\nOn the plane Becky watched a movie called “Anyone but you”. I watched Dune part 2. That movie is two and a half hours long and I was only able to get through 2 hours of it before we landed, so I will have to try to watch the last half hour of the movie on the return trip.\nWhen we landed in Puerto Vallarta it was raining and our bags got a little wet. We got our bags searched at customs. Apparently they saw something on the X-ray that looked a little suspicious. So we got pulled aside and they wanted to know if we had any rice or beans. The inspector wanted to know why we had so much food with us and we told him we were staying in a condo. He wanted to know if we lived in Puerto Vallarta, and we told him we were only visiting. Then he said what are you doing with all that food? I said we’re staying in a condo with a kitchen. I bet he thought, what a couple of dumb gringos; don’t they know there are supermarkets in Mexico?\nSo after poking around in our suitcase for a little bit he let us go because we didn’t have any fresh meat, vegetables, medical products or anything prohibited.\nAt the LA airport, we saw somebody carry on to the plane a fresh bouquet of flowers. They carried them all the way to Puerto Vallarta. At customs where they inspect your bags we didn’t see the flowers anymore so I guess they had to throw them away.\nAt the airport at Puerto Vallarta there is a VIP arrivals lounge so we stopped in there to get some food and some drinks (a benefit of the Chase credit card). We planned to eat a bit of food since we weren’t going to cook anything that night for dinner. We shared a ham sandwich and a veggie burrito. Both were good and we had some vegetable sticks with ranch dressing. Becky had a margarita and I had a beer.\nSince it was raining outside we decided to take a taxi to the resort instead of Uber. Uber is not allowed into the airport, so to call an Uber requires a short walk to get to the main road. We didn’t want to walk in the rain and get our luggage wet.\nAt the resort we had a short wait to check in. As we were checking in, Becky and I both started to feel really sick. At first, I felt kind of faint and started sweating. I had to ask for a glass of water and then as we were finishing up Becky started feeling really sick so she went outside to sit down.\nAfter a few minutes I started feeling better and then Becky felt better and we collected our bags and walked to our room. A few minutes after arriving in the room the porter showed up with our three big bags. He asked if we had any questions about the room and told us where the air conditioning controls were. By then we were both feeling better and we did some unpacking and went to bed early. We think it was something we ate at the VIP arrivals lounge that made us sick. But it was strange that it came and went so quickly. Maybe the ranch dressing was bad, who knows?"

    "text": "Sunday, August 25, 2024\nI got up early and made a cup of coffee and had a granola bar. I worked on my computer for a little bit. The resort has internet access through an open WiFi network. Since an open WiFi has lots of security risks associated with it, I activated a VPN service that I subscribe to for these occasions.\nLater in the morning, around 9am, we got ready to go down to the beach. First we stopped by the concierge because we had received a note at our door and it was in Spanish and I couldn’t really understand what it was saying. I thought it had something to do with housekeeping so we brought it to the concierge to have her translate it for us. It turns out it was an invitation for our welcome drink which we probably should have gotten last night but no one said anything to us.\nWe met with Gladys and she explained the activities for the week and asked if we had any questions. She asked when the last time we were here, but I think she already knew we were here last October. That meant we were not eligible for the full timeshare presentation which I was personally happy not to be eligible to attend a three hour presentation. She told us that there is a welcome party tonight at 6pm in the theater, but all of the other shows for this week were canceled (because it’s the rainy season) and they would just have themed night meals in the buffet. We will probably skip the themed dinners and just have a late lunch in the buffet on the days we eat out.\nOvernight they slipped a notice under our door which said that the main pool was going to be closed which kind of surprised us since we didn’t expect it to be closed until September, after we had departed. As a result the adult pool is open to everybody and it is pretty crowded in the afternoon.\nToday the ocean conditions are a yellow flag. On previous visits the flags have been red or black. Yellow is caution whereas red or black is dangerous or high risk.\nToday we’re at palapala #206 which is one row from the sidewalk and we just have a few short steps to the pool and going in the other direction we’re about six rows back from the beach. The temperature in the morning is 85F and the skies are clear.\n\n\n\npalapala #206\n\n\nThe resort seems a lot less crowded this morning with only a few people on the beach. But as I mentioned earlier the pool is crowded and all the chairs in the shade are taken.\nThis morning there doesn’t seem to be any Beach Attendants around and everyone has to drag their own loungers and chairs to wherever they want to sit. They can even hang out in the reserve section, whereas last year we got kicked out of the reserved section.\nAt 11:30 we went inside to order our welcome drinks because we plan to bring those drinks to lunch with us. Becky ordered a margarita and I had a beer. Becky said her margarita was not that good. We had lunch at the beachside restaurant. Becky ordered fish tacos and I ordered pork tacos, three tacos each, which we shared. Becky liked the pork tacos better than fish tacos. Though both types were good. The total price was $368 MX pesos ($19 USD) including discounts, tax and tip.\n\n\n\nbeer at beach resturant\n\n\nAt noon the temperature had risen to 90°F, still pleasant in the shade since there was a steady but warm breeze off the ocean. By then the sand was too hot to walk on without shoes or flip-flops. There’s a lot more people at the beach.\nAt 1:30 we called it quits for our beach time and headed back to the room for showers and to get ready for grocery shopping.\n\n\n\nThere are some of the birds at the resort. Their cages are along the way to the market.\n\n\nThere’s a small market located about 10 minutes walk from the resort. We picked up supplies for making breakfast (eggs), sandwiches for lunch (bread, lunch meat and sliced cheese), bottled water, Mexican beer, corn chips etc. Groceries cost $635 MX pesos ($33 USD).\nAt 6 pm we went to the welcome show which consisted of a cultural dance put on by about six performers. Drinks and a small plate of food was served. We didn’t eat any of the food because we saw the plates of food sitting out in the warm weather for at least an hour before the show started. From our balcony on the 8th floor we could see the setup and preparation area. We did drink Margaritas and a rum punch. Also they passed out popcorn in the little bags. After the show there was a drawing for prizes. They raffled off dinners and spa passes. We didn’t win anything.\n\n\n\nWelcome show\n\n\n\n\n\nToday’s sunset"

Later, when Becky got up, I made scrambled eggs with potatoes and diced ham.\nAround 9am we went to the beach. The sky was clear, the wind was calm and there were some little flies buzzing around and pestering us. About an hour later the breeze picked up and little pests were gone. The temperature this morning was 90°F. The ocean condition flags were changed from red to yellow about one hour after we arrived.\nAround 11am we decided to have our picnic lunch. Lunch was ham and cheese sandwiches, chips and crackers. Becky brought down a small container of white wine and I had a can of beer. We had to be sneaky with our food and drinks because coolers and picnic baskets are not allowed on the beach. So I keep my portable cooler in my backpack and the cooler police don’t bother us. Around 2 pm we went back to the room to take our showers.\nIn the afternoon it started to get cloudy over the mountains and it looked like there were some thunderstorms forming. In the evening there was a pretty good lightning show. We saw 10 or so flashes of lightning every minute or two. Most of the time we didn’t hear any thunder so the lightning was either far away or the wind was blowing in the wrong direction. We could also see rain showers in the distance. Being up on the 8th floor we had a good view of the mountains.\nDinner tonight was chicken and rice burritos that we made in our kitchen. Later we watched a movie called, The Devil’s Peak, the movie was pretty bad. Becky said it must have been one of the movies I picked out, but I actually think she picked out that movie.\n\n\n\nThis is the adult/quiet pool, but now being used as the main pool and all day long loud music plays. The music is OK, a mix of oldies and latin pop. So far no rap music. About every two hours some kind of pool activity is hosted. Starting with water aerobics and later some trivia type games. Today’s trivia was music trivia and about half of the songs were latin. The only song we recognized was the theme song to the TV show Hawaii 5-O.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is some construction and renovation taking place. From our balcony we have a good view of the workers. When we made our reservation we read that some buildings were going to be undergoing renovation and starting September 2nd, the main pool would be closed. We can hear some sawing and pounding. The noise isn’t bothering us and it’s interesting to watch the workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sunset tonight was pretty good because of all the clouds and thunderstorms."

    "text": "Tuesday, August 27, 2024\nWhen we arrived at the beach around 9am, a lot of the beach furniture was picked up, something the staff must do every evening. So this morning we had to drag loungers and chairs to the palapala where we wanted to sit. It took Becky a while to choose one she liked and we ended up moving once. It’s kind of hard to pick one when you have like 500 to choose from.\nThe skies this morning were mostly clear with a few high wispy clouds. This morning’s temperature is 85° F. No breese and no bugs.\nThis morning the red flags are out. About an hour after we got to the beach the flags were changed to yellow. So maybe they just always put the red flags out overnight and then change them to whatever they need to be around 10am.\nOn our first beach walk of the day, Becky stepped on a bee. The bee stung her on the bottom of her foot near her big toe. I had to pull the stinger out. When we got back to our palapala, I consulted Nurse Google, who recommended putting ice on the area to reduce the swelling, assuming she wasn’t having an allergic reaction. On the positive side we did find seven pesos while on our walk. We also saw a couple other bees, so I’m not sure what they’re doing down on the beach.\nOne thing about sitting on the beach is we always get asked every 5 minutes if you want to buy something by the beach vendors. They’re always dressed in white and they sell hats, sunglasses, blankets, dresses, wood carvings, cigars, real silver jewelry, t-shirts with funny sayings like Jose Deere with a picture of a donkey instead of a tractor. Twenty minutes later the same guy comes around with the same stuff asking us if we want to buy anything.\n\n\n\nbeach vendor\n\n\nOne thing about having the main pool closed is they moved all of the activities to the adult pool. The staff set up the PA system at the quiet pool and they play music, make stupid announcements and run all sorts of activities. The announcements are given twice, once in Spanish and again in English. The music is old tunes from the ’80s, Latin pop music, some disco and techno dance music. The music would be okay except the volume is way too loud, you can’t even talk to anybody while in the pool.\nLunch was ham and cheese sandwiches and tortilla chips. Dinner tonight was tuna, mac and cheese and green beans.\nLater we watched a movie and made popcorn. I brought a HDMI cable to connect my laptop to the TV. The movie was a comedy streamed from Amazon Prime.\nAt 7pm we walked back to the beach to watch the sun set. After dark we sat on our balcony and watched the lightning from the thunder storms that built up in the afternoon.\n\n\n\nsun set"

The beach attendant was roaming around and he set up the chairs at our favorite palapala, number 206. Yesterday we were at number 306 about 10 ft away. Number 206 is nice because in addition to the palapala there are some tall palm trees which also provide shade in the morning.\nThis morning the skies are mostly clear with a few scattered high clouds. The temperature this morning is 85°. Later today there is a 40% chance of rain.\nBecky’s big toe where the bee stung her swelled up last night. This morning she is feeling better but her toe is still a little swollen. According to Nurse Google the swelling can last up to one week.\nOn our first walk down the beach today we saw more bees just crawling around on the sand by the water’s edge. I’m not sure what they were doing down there; sometimes the waves come up and wash them away. On our walk we took some pictures of the resort adjacent to us called the Occidental. Then I walked as far as the Hard Rock Resort. On the way back I found 10 pesos. I’m not sure why there are Mexican pesos just lying in the sand. So far we found 17 pesos, about $1 USD.\n\n\n\nOccidental\n\n\n\n\n\npalm tree shadows\n\n\nWe finished up at the beach around 2:15 and went back to the room for showers. The plan is to stop by the main lobby to check on our room charges and go to the bank to get some pesos for the taxi ride back to the airport on Saturday.\nOur room charges were correct. We then walked to the Mall, about 10 minutes away. We were surprised to see they had a nice big laundromat and food court with McDonald’s, Subway and 5 or 6 other restaurants. Next door to the mall was a Citibanamex Bank with three ATMs. So I withdrew 500 pesos ($23 USD). The taxi to the airport for 1 to 4 passengers is 240 pesos ($12.22 USD).\nThe movie tonight was “I am Celin Dion”, a documentary about her health problems.\n\n\n\nsun set 1\n\n\n\n\n\nsun set 2"

The weather forecast for today: 88°F, humidity 58%, Scattered thunderstorms. Chance of rain 50%. Last night at about 1 am there was a big thunderstorm with rain.\nBreakfast was coffee and granola for me and Becky had oatmeal. We did not pack lunch since the plan is to have lunch at the resort’s buffet.\nToday we are at palapala #403. The palapalas are laid out in a 8 by 45 grid with some missing areas for the restaurants, towel shack and volleyball court. So there are around 300 palapalas to choose from.\nI went swimming in the ocean today and the water is very warm. The ocean water is even warmer than the pool and I think the pool is too warm. I wish the pool was just a smidge cooler because it’s not really that refreshing.\n\n\n\nThunderheads looking south\n\n\nThunderstorms forming over the mountains. Typical weather pattern for this time of the year is afternoon thunderstorms and here’s an example of a big thunder head over the mountains.\nWe finished up our vitamin sunshine therapy around 1:30 p.m. and came inside to take our showers and get ready to have lunch either at the resort’s buffet or at a restaurant in the mall. When we went back to our room, it had not been made up for the day as it had been on other days.\nOur plans for lunch were a bust. The resort is not running their lunch buffet today and I was really looking forward to having at least five plates of food and dessert. After looking at the reviews for the restaurants in the nearby mall, we decided to have lunch at the beach restaurant where we had tacos earlier in the week. Lunch was 768 pesos including tax and tip ($39 USD).\nBecky ordered the fish tacos and I ordered the tacos El pastor (pork). Becky had a slushy drink called a Rocky and I had a Mexican beer, and we shared a plate of onion rings for starters.\n\n\n\nlunch drinks\n\n\nThe Rocky is made from rum, vodka, mango, grenadine, lime juice and simple syrup.\nThe movie tonight was Invisible Man streamed from Amazon Prime.\nAt 7pm we walked down to the beach to watch the sun set.

The skies are mostly clear with a few high clouds and some thunderheads in the distance.\n\n\n\nthunderheads looking north\n\n\nAround 10:20 am we went to swim in the pool. We were talking to a guest who is from Riverside when we saw the pool concierge walk around the pool asking people in the pool who’s towels are these? Then he held up a boogie board that was left on one of the loungers and asked if this belonged to anybody. He was picking up items that people had left on chairs and loungers in order to reserve them.\nThen we saw a guy from his third or fourth floor balcony yelling at the pool guy in Spanish, but the pool concierge didn’t hear him. A few minutes later he came running down and then he and the pool concierge got in an argument in Spanish. I really couldn’t understand what was being said, but the man took his boogie board and towel back to “his” umbrella and threw them down on “his” lounge chair. As he was walking back to his room and pool concierge was finishing his walk around the pool, they met up again and they had another real long conversation also in Spanish. Maybe the gist of it was, “hey, you know everyone else is reserving chairs, why are you picking on me?” Then the guy goes back inside.\nWe had fun discussing all the drama with some of the other guests in the pool. None of us spoke Spanish well enough or could hear what was said, so we were just imagining and making up stuff about how the conversation was going. Anyway, the pool concierge walked off with two or three towels that he had collected from chairs that people were trying to reserve.\nWe had ham and cheese sandwiches for lunch with chips. I had a beer. Becky had a canned cocktail that we had bought from WinCo. She also had a half a glass of white wine.\nLater in the afternoon, we were entertained by about 20 birds who were helping themselves to a plate of french fries left at one of the palapalas when the guests went to swim in the ocean. The feeding frenzy ended when one of the waiters picked up the plate of mostly pecked over fries and took it away.\nBefore dinner we stopped by the front desk to check on our room charges, since we will be leaving tomorrow, we don’t want any surprises. Dinner tonight was tuna noodle casserole and other leftovers.\nAround 7pm we went out to watch the sunset. There was a lot of thunder and lightning and a little bit of rain in the area. The lifeguard made everyone get out of the ocean because of the nearby lighting. The flashes were very bright and I was keeping an eye out to see if I thought they were close, but the lighting was cloud to cloud from what I could see.\nWe noticed down the beach, off in the distance, that something kind of big had washed up. So we walked down to have a look, especially since some of the hotel staff were also down there. It turned out to be a large dead turtle. The lifeguard went to get a wheelbarrow and took the turtle away.\nThe movie tonight was Match Point. I gave up on it after about 30 minutes. Becky watched a bit more until it was time to watch the sunset. She will watch the rest of it at home.\nWe started packing and organizing our stuff for the trip home. Tomorrow we have an 11am checkout and a 3:35pm boarding time.\nThe sunset was somewhat obscured by a rain squall off in the distance.\n\n\n\nsun set\n\n\nWe have been staying in a one bedroom, two bath unit with a kitchen.

    "text": "Saturday, August 31, 2024\nBreakfast was scrambled egg burritos with refried beans and leftover rice. Since I was up early, I had two cups of coffee, some stale cookies and a granola bar.\nAfter breakfast I washed the dishes, did some final packing and tidying up. By 10:15am all our suitcases were packed and we’re just waiting in our room. I checked the Uber app and the price to the airport this morning is 230 pesos. The posted rate for a taxi is 250 pesos (a one US dollar difference). Taking the Uber requires schlepping our bags and a 5 minute walk to exit the resort (Uber is not allowed on to the resort for pickups).\nWhen we were in the lobby of our building the bellboy approached us to take our bags. I was walking over Becky’s bag to the main building, because I was making two trips. He said they don’t allow a lot of luggage in the lobby, so I said okay and that I need to get the rest of our bags. So back up the elevator I went to get the remainder of our bags.\nAt checkout, our wrist bands were cut off, we signed our bill and received two tags required to exit the resort. One tag to give to the bellboy that allowed us to retrieve our bags and the other tag for the guard shack. We waited in the lobby about 40 minutes before leaving the resort. Our resort charges were 1,137 pesos ($57 USD). I’ll have to check my credit card in a few days because when we checked in, a 10,000 peso ($500 USD) hold was applied to my card.\nWe left the resort about 11:55 am and arrived at the airport about 20 minutes later. We had a 40 minute wait for the Alaska counter to open. We were 1st in line.\nAfter checking our bags, we headed through security where we had to scan our boarding passes before our carry-ons were x-rayed.\nAt the airport there are two VIP lounges that we can access with the Chase Sapphire Credit Card. The first one was full, so we were offered a golf cart ride to the second, larger lounge. Getting a ride on the golf cart was kind of fun, but it seemed kind of slow, since we could only go as fast as people were walking through the narrow passageways.\nWe stayed at the VIP lounge for about one and a half hours. I had a beer and Becky had a Mai Tai. The food was a combination of mini burritos, chicken noodle soup and chicken chow mein. Later Becky had an espresso Martini, which she didn’t like, so I drank some of it and it wasn’t too bad.\nOur meals on the flight home were chicken and rice for me; Becky had the shrimp pasta. I finished my movie (Dune part 2). Afterwards I listen to some music and read my book.\nWe arrived at the LAX baggage carousel at around 6:30pm. After about 15 bags came down the belt, it got jammed. One and a half hours later, it was fixed and we got our final bag. At 8:30pm we were on the bus to Van Nuys. The Traffic from Van Nuys to Ventura was light and we arrived home at 10:30 pm.\nOur stay at the resort was very relaxing. This was the 3rd time we have stayed at this resort and I would come back here again. The staff at the resort is very attentive and friendly. About half of the guests are Mexican Nationals. Last time, there were a lot of Canadians here, this time most of the English speakers were American.\nOur next trip is in 22 days, a cruise on Oceania Riviera, round trip, departing San Pedro to San Francisco for seven days."

    "text": "Juneau – June 5\nToday we are in Juneau and the weather is rainy and 50F. The rain is forecasted to last all day long. There are five cruise ships in port - Celebrity Solstice (2,852 double occupancy), Grand Princess (2,600 double occupancy), Noordam (1,924 double occupancy), Norwegian Jade (2,402 double occupancy) and the Oceania Riviera. It is also a tender port for the Riviera. On account of the gloomy weather Becky and I are staying on board today.\n\n\n\nA rainy day in Juneau.\n\n\nAfter breakfast we participated in the regularly scheduled activities, bocce ball, bean bag toss, etc. There are usually two activities scheduled in the morning, one at 930am and the other at 1030am, there are two more activities in the afternoon. So far we have skipped trivia on this cruise. We have collected about 100 Big-O points. Attending these activities also gives us a chance to socialize with the other passengers. One of the passengers gave us a bottle of wine, which was much appreciated since we don’t have the drink package on this cruise. Since the bottle was provided by the ship we don’t have to pay the corkage fee if we bring the wine to dinner.\nWe had dinner in the main dining room tonight. Becky had braised leg of lamb. She said it was OK, but she would not get it again. Today, she had lamb chops for breakfast, lamb stew with rice for lunch and lamb again for dinner. I think she likes lamb. I had a bite of the braised lamb from her dinner because she said it tasted like beef, but I thought it was lammy and didn’t taste at all like beef. I had the Alaska Salmon, which was listed as the chef’s signature dish. It was good, but nothing spectacular.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBraised lamb.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlaskan Salmon.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe attended two musical performances tonight. The first one, called Jukebox Hero, was very good. The evening show in the theater was called Motor City Moved, which was a mashup of Motown hits choreographed with dancers and singers. We had a hard time staying awake during this one. For some reason, we are always sleepy during these 915pm shows."

    "text": "Sitka – June 6\nThis morning we were in Sitka and docked about six miles from town. The Viking Venus (930 double occupancy) was docked next to us. The weather today was overcast with a slight breeze, 50F and little chance of rain. After breakfast and bocce ball we boarded the bus into town.\n\n\n\nSitka cruise ship port.\n\n\nOur first stop was the Russian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Michael. The building was originally built in 1848, burned down in 1966 and reconstructed. Today, it houses a collection of Russian Orthodox art and church artifacts. The Cathedral was closed the last time we were here, so we were glad to see that it was open today.\n\n\n\nRussian Orthodox Cathedral of St. Michael.\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the Russian Orthodox Cathedral.\n\n\nWe did some window shopping along the main street. One interesting shop was the Sea Salt Company, which sold 4 oz bags of salt for $15 or $3.75 per oz. This is an astronomical price considering that you can get sea salt from Amazon.com for 2 cents per oz. At another store canned Alaska salmon was selling for $16 for a 6.5 oz can. Years ago we bought a can of Alaska salmon and it didn’t taste any better than the canned salmon we could buy at home in the grocery store.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAlaskan sea salt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSmoked Alaska Salmon.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur next stop was Castle Hill, the location where the transfer of Alaska from Russia to the United States officially took place in 1867. From there we walked to Totem Square, where a signal totem pole stands. We continued to Pioneer Bar & Liquor Store to have a look inside, but see anything that we needed to buy. Our next stop was the Russian Block House, which is a replica of the guard tower that was part of the Russian fort that enclosed the settlement. Nearby was the Russian Cemetery where a few historic headstones are located.\n\n\n\nThis structure is a re-creation of the guard tower that once stood here, part of the fortress enclosing the Russians during their time in Sitka, from 1804 to 1867. Fearful of the wilderness around them, and of Tlingit Natives, the Russians’ enclosed fort was open to outsiders only in the daytime. A massive fence, with three guard towers like this block tower, separated the fort from the rest of Baranof Island.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe stopped to take a selfie in a Driveway Mirror at St. Peter’s Episcopal Church, also known as St. Peter’s by the Sea and it’s a historic church in Sitka.\n\n\nOur last stop was the Sitka National Historical Park, which was established in 1890 and is Alaska’s oldest national park. The park encompasses 113 acres and preserves the site of the 1804 Battle of Sitka, a significant conflict between the Tlingit people and Russian forces. The park contains an impressive collection of authentic Tlingit and Haida totem poles.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTotem poles inside the visitor’s center at the Sitka National Historical Park.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA totem pole along the Totem Trail loop.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spotted an eagle up in the tree eating something.\n\n\nAround 2pm we were on the return bus to the cruise ship port. We ordered a few snacks from room service and at 4pm attended afternoon tea. Before dinner there was a party for repeat Oceania cruisers and free drinks were served!\nWe had dinner in the main dining room and we both ordered the halibut, which was excellent. Later we went to the show, but left after three songs. The performer was billed as a troubadour and storyteller. His mix of songs and stories just didn’t hold our interest. Good thing we sat in the back so we could make an easy exit.\nAnother daily activity is the Mensa Quiz, worth one Big-O point. I hadn’t been doing this activity, but today I joined a lady from Coeur d’Alene, for the afternoon trivia. She and another lady who we see at bocce ball were on a trivia team and asked me to join their team. The Mensa Quiz is corrected after trivia and a new question sheet is distributed afterwards. The Mensa Quiz is a take home quiz to work on at your leisure. So I decided to attend while Becky was off doing something else, but later she stopped by. The trivia questions are hard. Today there were about 15 teams participating. These two ladies were on a team by themselves, so maybe they were looking for more brain power when they asked me to join. For each question, we would quietly discuss possible answers/guesses and she would write down our answers. Normally this would be only the best answer, but she would write down the three or four candidate answers we had talked over. I thought she would eventually select one answer, but no. When it came time to go over the answers - and everyone corrects their own sheets, if we happened to have written down the correct answer as one of our guesses, she would erase the wrong guesses and give us one point. I’ve never seen this method of grading used before; but when you grade your own work, you can be very easy on yourself. With this advantage, we ended up getting second place.\nSo after Trivia, the answers to yesterday’s Mensa Quiz were covered and two Big-O points are awarded for all correct answers and one point for participation. I took a photo of today’s quiz with my phone, converted the image to text and copied the questions into Google’s Gemini, its generative artificial intelligence chatbot and large language model. Here are the questions and Google’s answers. It’s amazing what Artificial Intelligence is capable of. Google’s Gemini provides an explanation of its solution in some cases.\n\nSonya (also called Sophia) Kovalevsky was born in Moscow and earned a doctoral degree from the University of Gottingen. She has a very prestigious occupation for a woman of her time. What was it?\n\nAnswer: mathematics\n\nStart with the number of sides on a cube; multiply by the square root of 25, then add the number represented by the Roman numeral X. What number do you get?\n\nHere’s how to solve the problem:\n\nNumber of sides on a cube: A cube has 6 sides.\nSquare root of 25: The square root of 25 is 5.\nMultiply: 6×5=30.\nRoman numeral X: The Roman numeral X represents the number 10.\nAdd: 30+10=40.\n\nYou get the number 40.\n\nWhich of the words below is least like the others? KNIGHT DAME KNAVE SCION\n\nLet’s analyze each word:\n\nKNIGHT: In historical and social contexts, a knight is a person granted an honorary title of knighthood by a monarch or other political leader for service to the monarch or country, especially in a military capacity.\nDAME: In British English, “Dame” is the title given to a woman equivalent to a knight. It’s an honorific.\nKNAVE: Historically, a knave was a male servant or a boy. Later, it came to mean a dishonest or unscrupulous man. In playing cards, it’s the Jack.\nSCION: A scion is a descendant of a notable family.\n\nKNIGHT, DAME, and KNAVE (in its original sense of a boy or servant, or its modern usage as a card) all historically refer to specific roles or titles within a social hierarchy, often with a connection to service, royalty, or social standing. “Knight” and “Dame” are explicitly honorific titles. “Knave” has evolved, but its roots are in a defined social position.\nSCION, however, primarily refers to lineage or descent – being an offspring of a particular family. While it implies a certain status due to that family connection, it doesn’t represent a title or a defined social role in the same way the others do.\nTherefore, SCION is the least like the others because it describes a relationship of descent rather than a title, rank, or specific social role.\nGoogle got this one wrong. The correct answer is DAME, the only one with a silent consonant.\n\nThe blanks below can be filled in with words spelled with the same four letters in different order. Can you find them?\n\nThere once was a musical, _ _ _ _.\nIt was performed in three _ _ _ _.\nWhen it was through, The audience flew.\nAnd all of the _ _ _ _ went _ _ _ _ .\nThere once was a musical, CATS\nIt was performed in three ACTS\nWhen it was through, The audience flew.\nAnd all of the CAST went SCAT\n\nWhich of the scrambled words below is least like the others? The difference has nothing to do with vowels, consonants or syllables. CLBOAT CHEAP PEGAR PPEALENIP\n\nLet’s unscramble the words:\n\nCLBOAT -&gt; COBALT (a chemical element, a metal)\nCHEAP -&gt; PEACH (a fruit)\nPEGAR -&gt; GRAPE (a fruit)\nPPEALENIP -&gt; PINEAPPLE (a fruit)\n\nNow let’s look at the meanings:\n\nCOBALT: A metallic element.\nPEACH: A fruit.\nGRAPE: A fruit.\nPINEAPPLE: A fruit.\n\nTherefore, COBALT is the least like the others because it is a metal, while the other three are all fruits."

    "text": "Sea day – June 7\nToday was a sea day. The ship entered Disenchantment Bay and in the morning from 8 to 10 am we were at the face of Hubbard Glacier. The ship spun around three times so that everyone got a good view from all spots on the ship. We viewed the glacier from the balcony of our stateroom.\nHubbard Glacier is the largest tidewater glacier in North America. It stretches 76 miles in length and is seven miles wide at its face where it meets the ocean. The glacier towers at a height of 600 feet at its terminal face, with approximately 350 feet visible above the waterline and 250 feet submerged below. The glacier is located about 200 miles northwest of Juneau and originates from the ice fields of the Centennial Range in the Saint Elias Mountains in Yukon, Canada. Unlike many other glaciers worldwide that are currently retreating, Hubbard Glacier has been growing in thickness and advancing since 1895.\n\n\n\nThe bow of the ship was open for viewing the glacier. I went out to have a look. It was cold and raining out there and the views weren’t really that great from this location.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis picture was taken with our little Canon pocket camera which has a 12x zoom. In this frame you can see a small tour boat and the Viking Venus in front of the glacier. From this perspective you can see how tall the face of the glacier is. It looked like the Viking Venus got a lot closer to the glacier than we did.\n\n\n\n\n\nSome ice in the water next to the ship.\n\n\nAfter leaving Disenchantment Bay we sailed into the open waters of the Gulf of Alaska and the ship encountered some heavy seas with 20 foot swells. This made us look like drunks when walking down the hallways. Every three or four minutes the ship encounters a set of deep swells and the ship really pitches up and down. The rolling motion is not too bad.\nWe scored another bottle of wine from a couple from Minnesota who don’t drink. We took the wine to dinner and it was OK. Becky had shrimp for dinner and thought it was so-so. I had the roasted Filet Mignon and it was really good. We skipped the show tonight. We heard from other passengers that they also have trouble staying awake in the theater. Good to know that it’s not just us.\nHere is today’s quiz with Google’s answers.\nMENSA DAILY QUIZ #10\n\nA statement, which is probably true, is coiled in the grid below. To spell it out, start with one letter and move to an adjacent letter in any direction. (Hint: Start with an “T”.)\n\nT F F E L L D N\nH I E T G I E N\nE D R N E N A S\nC N E I C E H A\nE B E Y T I D I\nE W T D S T U P\nE N T N A E C N\nN I E L L I G E\nGoogle came up with different answers that didn’t seem correct.\nGoogle’s answer: THE EYES ARE THE WINDOWS TO THE SOUL, AND THE HEART IS THE MIRROR OF INTELLIGENCE.\nI rearranged the letters into a line to see if that made any difference to Google.\nT F F E L L D N H I E T G I E N E D R N E N A S C N E I C E H A E B E Y T I D I E W T D S T U P E N T N A E C N N I E L L I G E\nGoogle’s answer: “THE EYES OF AN INTELLIGENT MIND ARE NEVER CLOSED.”\nGoogle was not able to provide the correct answer.\nThe correct answer: The difference between intelligence and stupidity – intelligence has an end.\n\nAn eight-letter word appears in the box below. Find it by beginning with the correct letter and moving clockwise or counterclockwise around the box, using each letter only once.\n\nD N O W S U O R\nThe eight-letter word is WONDROUS.\n\nPat is three times as old as she was 14 years ago. In seven years, she will be four times as old as she was 14 years ago. How old is she now?\n\nHere’s how to solve the problem:\nLet P be Pat’s current age.\nFrom the first statement: “Pat is three times as old as she was 14 years ago.” This translates to the equation: P = 3 * (P - 14)\nLet’s solve this equation for P: P = 3P - 42 42 = 3P - P 42 = 2P P = 21\nNow let’s check this with the second statement: “In seven years, she will be four times as old as she was 14 years ago.”\nPat’s age in seven years will be P + 7. Her age 14 years ago was P - 14.\nSubstitute the value of P (21) into these expressions: Pat’s age in seven years = 21 + 7 = 28 Pat’s age 14 years ago = 21 - 14 = 7\nThe second statement says: (P + 7) = 4 * (P - 14) Using the calculated values: 28 = 4 * 7 28 = 28\nBoth statements hold true with P = 21.\nTherefore, Pat is 21 years old now.\n\nFill in the blanks to complete the word below. C _ O _ E G _ _ P _ I _ _ _ LY\n\nThe word is CHOREOGRAPHICALLY.\n\nAn eight-letter word appears in the box below. Find it by beginning with the correct letter and moving clockwise and counterclockwise around the box, using each letter only once.\n\nU S I O N I L L\nILLUSION"

    "text": "Kodiak – June 8\nWe arrived at noon and stayed until 8pm. The weather was mostly sunny, windy and 60F. Kodiak is a very small town and the main city of seven communities on Kodiak Island. As of the 2020 census, the population of the city is 5,581.\n\n\n\nThe town of Kodiak, viewed from the ship.\n\n\nIn the morning we had breakfast in the main dining room and played Bocce Ball and carpet darts. The ship was still rolling and pitching with the large sea swells. As we approached Kodiak the seas calmed down.\nOur plan for today was to explore the town on foot. The tender ride to the harbor took about 20 minutes. Our first stop was at the Kodiak National Wildlife Refuge Visitor Center. Here there were a few small exhibits about the history and wildlife on the island. Most of the eastern part of the island is a wildlife preserve and the bear population has recovered to historical levels.\nNearby was Holy Resurrection Russian Orthodox Church; the doors were open and the parishioners were having a Sunday potluck on the grass in front of the church. The potluck looked like it was winding down. As we approached the church, one of them said welcome, go in and look around, so we did. He asked if we were Orthodox, we said no, Roman Catholic. He said, oh, you’re like our cousins. Inside the church are the relics of St. Herman, a Russian Orthodox monk and missionary to Alaska. He is considered by many Orthodox Christians to be the patron saint of North America. The church was established in 1794 and elevated to Cathedral status in 2001.\n\n\n\nHoly Resurrection Russian Orthodox Church.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe reliquary of St. Herman.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of the interior of the church.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were back on board by 2pm and went to lunch at Waves, the poolside burger venue on the ship. We both had the burgers, which were small, more like appetizer size. They were good. After lunch we went to the spa and I sat in the steam room while Becky went to shower and get ready for dinner.\nAfter attending one of the afternoon activities, we stopped into the future cruise office to ask a question and ended up making a deposit for a future cruise. We didn’t have a cruise in mind, so it’s just a $500 deposit, for which we will get back several hundred in credits and reductions once we do find a cruise to book. The $500 deposit doesn’t expire, but the credits and savings expire if we don’t book within 12 months. Actually, it was $500 for two deposits. We thought we could apply two deposits to a future reservation, which is the way cruise deposits for NCL work. Later we learned that we didn’t need to buy two, since only one deposit can be applied to a new reservation.\nAt 5pm we attended happy hour. We have been trying the various martinis on the menu. Becky didn’t care for the one we had tonight, since she prefers the sweeter drinks. We sat with the couple from Minnesota that had given us the bottle of wine the day before.\n\n\n\nTonight’s martinis: Showman Chaplin (named after Charlie Chaplin, the Academy Award-winning comic actor, filmmaker and composer.) - Bombay Bramble Gin, Chambord, Carpano Antica Formula Vermouth. I thought this one was good, but Becky didn’t care for the gin and vermouth taste.\n\n\nDinner tonight was in the Polo Grill, the steak house style restaurant. I had the Filet mignon and Becky had the rack of lamb."

    "text": "Homer – June 9\nToday’s port was the final port before disembarking tomorrow. We arrived at the dock in Homer at 7am. The captain had to make two approaches to the dock on account of the difficult winds and currents. The weather was mostly sunny with strong winds and 45F.\nAfter breakfast in the main dining room and playing a round bocce ball and carpet darts, I headed ashore with another passenger that we became acquainted with over the cruise. Becky did not want to go ashore and his wife was still feeling a bit sick from the rough seas a few days ago.\nThe Homer Spit is a narrow strip of land extending 4.5 miles into the waters of Kachemak Bay. Located on the spit is a large dock that can accommodate large ships, the Homer Harbor, home to a large fleet of fishing boats and a variety of shops and restaurants which are located at the end of the road.\nWe stopped to look inside the historic Salty Dawg Saloon before returning to the ship. The Salty Dawg Saloon is a well-known landmark on the Homer Spit. The building originally was one of the first cabins built in Homer in 1897. It was acquired in the late 1940s by Chuck Abbott and in 1949 Chuck and his friend Gerald Gifford put the cabin on skids and moved it to the Homer Spit. In April 1957, he officially opened it as the Salty Dawg Saloon. The Salty Dawg Saloon has its walls and ceiling covered with dollar bills people have stapled to the walls. Becky did some packing in the afternoon while I was out exploring the end of the split.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Salty Dawg Saloon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the Salty Dawg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the businesses along the highway on the Homer Spit. This road is the end of the Sterling Highway, a 138-mile-long state highway leading from the Seward Highway at Tern Lake Junction, 90 miles south of Anchorage, to Homer.\n\n\nWe received 20 Big-O points each for completing the art scavenger hunt. The redemption of Big-O points occurred today and Becky was able to get a polo shirt, a jacket and an active wear t-shirt. We have some leftover points which we will take home to use on a future Oceania cruise.\nThe ship pulled away from the dock at 2pm and sailed for Whittier, the terminus to our cruise.\nWe attended afternoon tea. Snow covered peaks and spots of blue sky provided a very scenic view as we sipped tea and ate the small sandwiches and sweets.\nWe had happy hour drinks with the couple from Minnesota that we had met a few days ago. After happy hour the four of us went to dinner in the main dining room. Becky and I both had the braised beef short ribs, which were very good. It was 845pm by the time we finished dinner, but there was still light outside which made it seem earlier.\n\n\n\nThis martini is called the Bardot (after Brigitte Bardot, the French actress, singer and model.) - Mermaid Pink Gin, Campari, Lemon Juice and Pineapple Purée.\n\n\nWe finished packing our two big suitcases and put them out in the hallway by 10pm for delivery ashore tomorrow morning. We have not been to the port of Whitter, so we didn’t know if it would be easy to carry off our large suitcases. So rather than chance it, we will have them delivered to the cruise terminal tomorrow."

    "text": "Disembark – June 10\nToday is the day we disembark the ship in Whittier. We woke up early to do our final packing. Last night we had set our bags in the hallway with Gray 6 luggage tags attached. I should have asked for a different color had I known the offloading of luggage was going to be so slow. Our bus from Whittier was scheduled to leave at 945am, which based on past experience at other terminals would have given us plenty of time to collect our luggage and make it to the bus on time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe dock and ramps leading to the cruise ship terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDeparting passengers being directed where to walk from the dock to the terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassenger bags being loaded into trucks.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis photo was taken from the bus window.\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 915am we decided to leave the ship even though our group had not been called. From the pace it was going, it didn’t seem like our group was going to be called any time soon. I called the bus company and the representative said to just get on the bus. Leaving without our two big bags didn’t make any sense to us. I thought at least I could find the driver and explain that we didn’t have our bags and ask how long he could wait. It turns out the bus was going to be delayed by an hour and when we finally got our bags, we ended up waiting for another 30 minutes on the bus before leaving.\nIt’s a 15 minute walk from the dock to the terminal. Most of the walk is outside and if it was raining, everything and everyone would be getting wet. My rain parka and umbrella were packed in my big suitcase. I should have kept them with me. Thankfully It wasn’t raining. So if we ever come back here again, that’s something to remember.\nThe tunnel out of Whittier is a one lane tunnel shared by autos, trucks, buses and trains. The north bound traffic has a top of the hour time assignment, so once our bus was delayed, it would have to wait in increments of one hour for a time slot.\n\n\n\nLooking out the front of the bus while driving along the one lane road in the tunnel.\n\n\nAbout 1040am our bus departed the cruise terminal and by 1230pm we were dropping off passengers at the airport, our first stop. We didn’t make it to our hotel until 215pm. After checking in and doing some unpacking we walked to a shopping center to look around. For dinner we walked to a nearby restaurant.\n\n\n\nInside the Bear Paw Bar & Grill, where we had dinner.\n\n\nAs we were leaving the restaurant, I recognized an older couple who was on the ship with us, so I said hello. They ask how long we would be staying in Anchorage and like us, they would be spending an extra day here. As we were walking back to our hotel, he came running after us and asked what hotel we were at. We told him, he said he was at Motel 6. He asked if they served breakfast at our hotel and we said yes, he replied that he might join us. We thought that was weird since we hadn’t spoken with them while on the ship and didn’t really know them."

The food was OK.\nThe weather was sunny, 60F and no wind. We left the hotel around 830am to ride the city bus downtown. Seniors (60+) ride free on Wednesdays. The bus ride took about 20 minutes.\nThe first item on our list to see was Wyland’s Whaling Wall titled, Alaska’s Marine Life, and painted on the west wall of the J.C. Penney’s building in Anchorage’s Town Square. The mural was painted in 1994.\n\n\n\nWyland’s Whaling Wall, Alaska’s Marine Life.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Sleeping Lady Mural which depicts Mount Susitna. This mural is the work of Anchorage artist Justin Parsons.\n\n\nThe Legend of the Sleeping Lady is as follows:\n\nMany millennia ago, a clan of gentle giants inhabited the Great Land, now known as Alaska. Among the giant people was a beautiful young lady and a handsome young man who fell deeply in love with each other. Their unbound devotion was so joyous that all the villagers admired them, and preparations for marriage were underway. On the day before the wedding, a messenger brought dreadful news that a fierce war-like people from the north were invading the country and destroying everything in their path. The village gathered in council to decide what to do. Some suggested going north to attack. The young love-filled man proposed taking gifts to the enemies instead of weapons, showing their interest was in peace and not bloodshed. By morning, the brave volunteers were ready to leave. The young lady had tears of sadness when her lover came to say goodbye. He gazed softly into her eyes and whispered, “I shall return soon with news of peace. Meet me by the slender body of water with two arms.” With one gentle kiss, he turned and joined the departing men. The young woman hurried to the pool of water, known today as the Knik Arm, and began the wait, confident that she would soon be back in her mate’s arms. For many days and nights she busied herself while waiting until, finally, she grew very weary and laid down to rest. She fell into a deep sleep. While she slept, tragic news reached the village that their young men’s pleas for peace had been in vain and a terrible battle had broken out. Most of the giant men were killed or captured. When the village women approached the young lady with the tragic news, they could not bear to disturb her from her peaceful sleep, and left her as she was. To this day, the sleeping lady lies there, dreaming of the moment her beloved will return to her side and peace once again rules the land. (This version of the legend of the Sleeping Lady was compiled from the stories of Nancy Lesh and Ann Dixon.)\n\nNearby was the AK Log Cabin, a visitor information center. Across the street was the Alaska Public Lands Information Center. We watched a short film about the public lands in Alaska. Here we ran into four Australians from the cruise. They were flying home later in the day. We also saw the Sleeping Lady Mural and Captain Cook’s monument.\n\n\n\nMileage to various locations around the world.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnchorage visitor center.\n\n\nWe had lunch at a place called the Glacier Brewhouse, a popular place with tourists. We both had Alaskan Cod fish tacos and beers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaving a beer in the brewhouse.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFish tacos.\n\n\n\n\n\nBack at the hotel I took a nap and at 5pm there was a manager’s social hour. Clam chowder, salad, cheese cubes and pita bread with hummus were being served. Two types of beer and red and white wine were also served.\nTomorrow we fly home. First leg is Anchorage to San Francisco and the second leg is San Francisco to LAX."

    "text": "Travel Home – June 12\nIn Anchorage we had the free hotel breakfast. Today it was pre-made cheese omelets, sausages, pulled pork, flour tortillas and coffee. I made a breakfast burrito.\nAfter breakfast we did our final packing and caught the hotel shuttle to the airport. The shuttle ride to the airport took only ten minutes. We weighed our bags at a packing station at the Alaska terminal and Becky’s bag was 44 pounds and mine was 48 pounds. Our bags seemed heavier than the 50 pound limit. At the checkin counter we were told that we were a bit early to check in our bags, but the agent sent our bags through anyway, because we were just a bit over the 4 hour limit to check in. Our plan was to arrive a bit early to spend a few hours in the Alaska Boardroom prior to our flight, but the hotel check out, waiting for the shuttle and ride to the airport took way less time than we had allotted.\nThe Alaska Boardroom Lounge in the Anchorage airport was nice. The food is free as well as basic alcoholic beverages. The boardroom was fairly empty when we arrived, but filled up later in the morning. Becky ordered a caramel latte and I had an IPA. Later we had some of the breakfast items. I made another breakfast burrito consisting of scrambled eggs, chorizo, cheese and sour cream.\nThe anchorage airport is a busy cargo hub and we saw lots of 747 cargo planes landing for fuel on their way to and from Asia or the US.\n\n\n\nLooking at the cargo planes.\n\n\nThe weather this morning was sunny and 55F. I tried to locate Denali as we took off, but I couldn’t pick it out. There are just too many snow covered mountains in Alaska. Our flight route took us out over the ocean all the way to Northern California. Most of the way was overcast, so there was nothing to see out the window until we got to San Francisco. We pre ordered our meals, I had the hamburger and Becky got a pasta entree.\n\n\n\nA view of the city of Anchorage shortly after takeoff.\n\n\nWe had a one hour layover in San Francisco and the Alaska Boardroom Lounge was conveniently almost directly across from our departure gate. We had about 30 minutes to spend in the Boardroom, just enough time to grab a bite to eat and a cup of coffee. The food being served was pasta and salad.\n\n\n\nA view of city of San Francisco and the bridges.\n\n\nThe flight from SF to LAX was about 1.5 hours long. When we arrived it was about 9pm and by 920pm we were on the Flyaway bus to Van Nuys. The traffic was light and by 11pm we were back home."

From my house it’s a 40 minute walk to Avis. The office opens at 9am and I was there about five minutes early. By the time the office opened at five minutes after the hour, there were three of us lined up and I was the first in line. It took about 20 minutes for the computers to get warmed up and for me to get my rental contract. The car I got this time was a Nissan Rogue. A decent car for a three hour drive south.\nI parked the car in the garage while we were still getting ready and when I moved the car out, I noticed that there were two small spots where oil was leaking, not a good sign. Later in the day, I got a message from Avis asking if I had found anything in the car. There was some trash and used tissues but no cooking pot, which the previous renter thought they had left in the car. The office was closed by the time I listened to my messages, so I called back on Monday.\nAfter loading our luggage into the car, we were on the road by 10:35 am for the 200 mile drive. We encountered a lot of stop and go traffic along Hwy-101 and I-405 near LAX. In Orange county the traffic also came to a stop for some large cardboard boxes and about five plastic Christmas tree stands scattered across three or four lanes. We stopped for lunch at Wendy’s. I gassed up the car at Costco in San Diego. This Costco has the smallest and most congested parking lot of any Costco that I’ve been to.\nOur hotel in San Diego is a Marriott Towneplace and not in the best location. This week there is a big convention in San Diego and most of the good hotels are fully booked. The hotel doesn’t have any parking for check-in. There is a $35 per day garage, but that makes no sense for someone just needing to park for a few minutes. I did find some 30 minute free parking on the street while we unloaded the car and checked in. After we dropped off our bags, I drove to the airport rental car terminal to return the car. From the terminal I walked about three blocks to the Middletown Station and took the San Diego Trolley downtown and from there a short walk back to the hotel. I did notice homeless people sleeping on the sidewalks near the Trolley stations and downtown at the civic center. Also there were some homeless riding the Trolley. The weather in San Diego was a bit on the cool side, partly cloudy with the temperature in the lower 60s.\nThe two restaurants that Becky had picked out for dinner were closed, so we bought sandwiches from Domino’s. Domino’s was convenient since it was across the street. We each had a ranch, chicken and bacon sandwich which we took back to our room to have with beer and chips that we had brought with us. The sandwich was toasted with a bit of melted cheese. It tasted good, but a bit on the dry side."

    "text": "San Diego, Monday, pre-cruise\nI got up early and I showered first. The shower was very weak, just above a dribble. The shower only has a temperature knob and no flow adjustment. I took the shower head off, found some debris like some small pieces of leaves and a seed. So I cleaned the junk out and removed the flow restrictor o-ring for good measure. Now the flow is almost too strong. Before checking out of the hotel, I’ll need to replace the little rubber o-ring.\nHotel breakfast was decent. I would rate it above average as far as free hotel breakfasts go. The coffee was good and there was a good selection of toppings for oatmeal. I was able to put together a DIY trail mix made from walnuts, pumpkin seeds, cranberries and chocolate chips.\nBacon, egg ham and cheese on a croissant breakfast sandwich, spinach and Swiss cheese crustless quiche.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nThe hotel has maid service every other day and since we are staying for two nights our room will not get made up. So after breakfast Becky called the front desk for a clean set of towels and a box of Kleenex. Caesar the robot delivered the supplies about five minutes later. Oscar speaks R2D2 and made boobs and beeps similar to the Star Wars robot.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nThe hotel has a Bluetooth beacon near the work desk. I’ve never seen one of these before. According to the ‘relay’ web page (https://relaypro.com/), this can be used by the hotel to track staff and provide guest services. I suppose in other words - to spy on guests and staff. Edward Snowden would be covering this with tape and aluminum foil.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nThe day started off with cloudy skies, then cleared up to mostly sunny. The high 63F and the winds were to 10 mph. In the shade with the slight breeze, it was a little chilly.\nAround 10:30 am we left the hotel and walked two blocks to the Trolley station and bought two one way tickets. My plan was to purchase an all day ticket, but they were not available at this ticket machine. While we were waiting for the next Trolley a security guard said hello and asked to see our tickets and we weren’t even on the train. The ride to Old Town took about 20 minutes.\nLast year when we visited Old Town, many of the shops were closed. Today, they all seemed open. The place was decorated for Christmas and many of the shops were selling Christmas items and decorations. We stopped into an olive oil shop and tasted some of the oil and balsamic vinegar. I would have bought some of the olive spread, but I didn’t want to carry it onto the cruise ship.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nThe doors to the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church were open so we stopped in to look at the church. They were having a service so we sat in the back for a few minutes. Today was the Feast of the Immaculate Conception and there were about 20 people attending the service.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nWe had lunch at a restaurant called Fred’s Tacos y Tequila. Becky had enchiladas and I had a burrito. The food was good and filled us up. This was going to be a late lunch or early dinner for us.\nAfter lunch we took the trolley to Little Italy and walked to the San Diego Maritime Museum. We had an AARP two for one coupon which Becky had printed before we left home. We spent about two hours exploring the ships. The Maritime Museum has five ships that can be viewed. The museum was not busy and we had the ships to ourselves for the most part. The Star of India and the submarine USS Dolphin were the most interesting to me.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nWe decided to walk back to our hotel, which was about a one mile walk over most flat ground. My step count for the day was 15,265 which Fit Bit says is 7.23 miles. Later we finished some of the snacks we had brought since we didn’t want to take them on to the cruise ship."

    "text": "Koningsdam, Embarkation, San Diego, Tuesday, December 10, 2024\nI woke at 6am to shower and do some packing. Breakfast selections this morning were sausage patties, scrambled eggs and jalapeno poppers. The jalapeno poppers weren’t that good. The sausage patties and eggs were typical hotel breakfast food. In other words, edible but nothing to rave about. There was one family with small kids in the breakfast dining room area. The other guests seem to be mainly business people.\nI put the flow restrictor o-ring back into the shower head and the shower flow with the restrictor is much better than it was before.\nToday is embarkation day. Our cruise is an 11 day Mexican Riviera and Sea of Cortez cruise.\nThis is the route of our cruise, six ports and four sea days.\n\n\n\nmap\n\n\nThe plan this morning was to leave our room at 10:40 am, check out of the hotel, call Lyft and wait in the lobby for the driver to show up. This should get us to the port around 11:00 am. The cruise check-in time printed on our tickets is for 12:00 noon. It says 12:00 noon for everybody so I wonder if the whole ship is going to show up at noon. I think the terminal actually opens at 11:00 am.\nWe left our room around 10:30 to check out. I called the Lyft and we had to wait about 10 minutes before he showed up. The drive to the cruise terminal took about 10 minutes where we unloaded our bags, walked right into the terminal, went through security and we were at the check-in counter a minute or two later. From there we walked directly onto the ship. We didn’t have to wait in any lines.\nOur first stop was at the restaurant reservation desk where we made reservations for the Italian restaurant for two nights and lunch at the steakhouse for two days. These are paid venues and we’ll use some of our on board credit to pay for these charges.\nWe went to our room to pick up our key cards and dropped off our carry-on bags. We needed our room keys in order to order drinks at lunch. Some guy in the elevator said that the rooms aren’t ready yet but we said we were going to go pick up our room keys. Our room was ready. We dropped off our bags and used the bathroom.\nWe stopped by the Neptune lounge to talk with the concierge and check out what they had to offer in the lounge. The assistant concierge gave us the orientation and explained what we could expect and what services they offer. The lounge is open from 7 am until 8 pm. Coffee, tea, wine, beer, sodas and snacks are available anytime the lounge is open.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nThe chocolate truffles (chocolate balls on the right) are good with coffee.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nThen we went to the Dutch Cafe for lunch. I got a ham and cheese sandwich, split pea soup, a side of fries and a Belgian beer. Becky ordered a ham and cheese sandwich, side of fries and the same type of beer.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nAfter lunch we want to explore the ship. We stopped by the spa and I made an appointment for a haircut later in the cruise.\nAt 1 pm we went to our assigned muster station to check in. We were told to watch the safety video on the TV back in our room.\nWe went back to the lounge to make a cup of coffee with their fancy coffee machine and then back to the room to see if our luggage had arrived. Only mine was there so I unpacked.\nOur cabin stewards stop by to say hello and give us an orientation. I mentioned that the water in the coffee maker was low and he said we can fill the reservoir from the sink. On other Cruise lines the butler does this for us. Here we will need to fend for ourselves.\nFor a change I was able to do all of my unpacking while we were waiting for Becky’s suitcase to arrive.\nWhen Becky’s suitcase arrived she was able to do some unpacking while making a mess of the room and moving many of my clothes out of her way. Our suitcases fit under the bead and we can roll them out if we need anything stored on there.\nLater we attended a raffle in the shops, but we didn’t win, but the prize was a nice selection of various Holland branded merchandise. We looked around at the merchandise to see what we were going to spend our credit on. I think I might buy a sweater or a shirt. Becky also found a shirt she liked. We will make these purchases later in the cruise once we see how our budget is working out.\nOur non-refundable on board credit amount is $1050. This is a lot more than we usually get. The credit comes from a combination of - a Cruise line promotion, something called Goodwill future cruise credit, AARP, “Welcome home” and Shareholder’s benefit. We hope about half of the credit can be applied to the daily service charge, as on previous cruises ($19 per person per day). We will monitor our room statement every day to make sure that the charges are being applied as we think they should. We also have a separate shore excursion credit and we will take a couple of shore excursions.\nAt 4pm we went back to the room to get ready and change for dinner.\nFor dinner Becky ordered the Chicken and corn soup: smoked chicken, roasted corn, scallions and bell pepper. This was a clear broth soup, which she said would be good if it was snowing outside and she had the cold. Her main dish was Beef Pot Roast: roasted parsnip and root vegetables, potato smash. She said this was good.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nI ordered a Classic Caesar salad to start. For my main course I ordered Mahi Mahi Diablo: Cilantro rice, guajillo chilies, chipotle, tomatoes. This was good and with just enough spice to make it interesting.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nAt 7pm we went to the Neptune lounge reception. Only six people attended. It was just a repeat of the orientation we got earlier in the day but with a glass of wine or champagne.\nLater we listened to the signers in the venue called Billboards. Here there are two pianos and two singers/players to entertain the guests with songs, usually following some theme. Tonight’s theme was “Hot 100” for the first set. Later in the evening the theme changed to “Hot R&B” and then requests for the last set of the evening."

I tried to make a cup of coffee with the coffee maker in our room, but it seems that the machine only makes small cups of espresso. Later I asked our room steward about making coffee and he said to call room service if I wanted coffee. Behind the coffee machine I found a bluetooth speaker, so now we can have some music in our room.\nWe attended an event called “Coffee with Alex”, who is the cruise director – we only stayed for a minute. She was interviewing the gift shop manager, who was from Zimbabwe. We then went to the art studio for a class. It was a good thing we arrived early since the class filled up and people were turned away.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nAs we were walking around the ship Becky found two ducks. Here is one of them.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nFor lunch we went to a Mexican brunch being offered in the main dining room. There was a signature drink suggested with the menu called the Pamplemousse Martini, so we ordered two of them.\nPamplemousse Martini: De Lijn Gin, grapefruit, lemon, St Germain liqueur. This was very tasty and not too sweet. The grapefruit and gin taste nice together.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nOn this cruise we have Holland’s version of the drink package. We each get 15 drinks per day, which seems like a lot, but bottled water and specialty coffee is included. We can’t combine our allotment of drinks so we need to drink responsibility and keep track of our drink count each day. Towards the end of each day, if we need water for a port day, we will pick up several cans of water to fill up our water bottles.\nPulled pork Carnitas Taco: soft tortilla, shredded jack cheese, avocado, cilantro, mango salsa. These were good and the mango salsa was very tasty.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nWe attended afternoon tea. We sat with a solo traveler from San Diego. She’s a retired judge advocate for the County and has been a widow for a few years. She is traveling with a friend she’s known from high school. She has been on more than 70 cruises.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nFor dinner, Becky had lamb chops for her main course and I had the Fresh Yellow Fin Sole Fillet. After dinner we attended the Captain’s welcome toast in the main theater. We stayed to watch the show in the theater, but we had seen it before and it was not very interesting. The show was just music and dancers dancing. So we left after about 15 minutes. Out on the lido deck there was a movie by the pool called - The Journey: A Musical Special from Andrea Bocelli. Popcorn was served during the movie. The movie is a few years old, and we stayed for part of the movie. The audio was slightly out of sync with the video and it was hard to follow the dialog."

I made espresso with the machine in our room and it was not good. The temperature was not hot enough to dissolve the small amount of sugar I added and the taste was very bitter.\nAfter breakfast we attended the morning coffee chat with the cruise director Alex. She was interviewing the art auctioneer, which was kind of interesting.\nThen we attended a cooking demonstration in the main theater. The chef cooked Grouper with rice pilaf and salsa picante. It was kind of like a cooking channel show. The cruise director interviewed the chef and would ask him questions about the food, his life and career while he chopped and cooked. The demonstration was interesting and entertaining.\n![caption](IMG_20241212_084702699.jpg)\nLunch today was in the Pinnacle Grill, the paid steakhouse. Lunch is served here on sea days for $20 per person plus 18%. To start we ordered cocktails. Becky had the Ritz Cocktail - maraschino liqueur, Courvoisier, Cointreau, lemon, Champagne. I had the Sao Paulo – Cachaca, coconut lime, passionfruit, vanilla. I never had a Sao Paulo, but the ingredients sounded good and I thought I’d give it a try. It was OK, but I wouldn’t get it again. Becky liked the Ritz Cocktail.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nWe both had the wedge salad, Becky had the Lamb chops, roasted baby beets with blue cheese and Key lime pie. I had the Sea Bass, Asparagus with Hollandaise sauce and Creme brulee. I had to send the sea bass back to be cooked a bit more. After that, it was good.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nIn the afternoon we attended trivia but we sat off to the side since it was packed. The theme was travel and from clues you needed to guess the city. We knew about half of the answers.\nSince today was another sea day, tea is served at 3pm which we ordered to be served in our room and we enjoyed tea on our balcony. We were on the shaded side of the ship and the temperature was 70F. So it was nice to have afternoon tea out in the fresh air.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nAfter dinner we attended the show in the main theater which was by the performer Tyler Bryce – his show combined comedy, singing and celebrity impressions. The show was entertaining."

Becky skipped coffee since today we have a shore excursion with a long bus ride. For breakfast, Becky had an omelet and I had - Aloo Masala and egg bhurji with paratha rava dosa; I ordered two sausages on the side since this is a Indian vegetarian breakfast. I’ve had this on previous cruises and I like it; it’s a bit on the spicy end of the spectrum.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nToday we arrived in Manzanillo around 930am and the ship was cleared by 10am. Our tour is called “Manzanillo’s Many Talents: Salt, Fruit & Clay Bricks”. The tour bus took us through the surrounding country. Coconut, mango, papaya, sugar cane and bananas are grown here. Our first stop was to a sea salt production facility; then onto a mango farm. The third stop was to a brick making facility. The final stop was to a little beach town called Balneario El Paraiso, where we had a snack and sampled some of the local fruit. The tour lasted about five hours, cost was $70 per person and we used some of our shore excursion credit to pay for the ticket. The tour was decent and it was interesting to see the tropical farms.\nHere are a few pictures from the excursion.\nAfter a few stages of concentration, the salt brine is pumped into these shallow plastic lined ponds to sit for a day until the salt falls out of the solution.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nHere I am sweeping up some of the salt.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nThis is jackfruit.

I decided to order an espresso (made from a legitimate espresso machine) and Becky ordered a latte. For breakfast Becky ordered buckwheat pancakes and I ordered the Pan Asian Breakfast – hot miso soup, steamed white rice, tamagoyaki and broiled salmon.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nWe spent the day by the main pool. The retractable roof was open and I sat at a table in the shade where I was able to read my book. Becky moved back and forth between a lounger in the sun and one in the shade. The water in the pool wasn’t too cold as it can sometimes be. By mid morning the ship was mostly empty since the majority of passengers had gone ashore. For lunch we ordered a pizza using the ship’s app. The app also informed us when the order was ready, which was very convenient. We ordered a pizza called the Tribeca – roasted chicken, red onion, cilantro, barbecue sauce, smoked mozzarella. I can’t remember when I last had a pizza, maybe six months ago. The pizza was good. Around 2pm passengers started to return and the loungers around the pool started to fill up. A bit later we went back to our room and sat on our balcony.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nDinner was at the Pinnacle Grill. Becky had the Short Ribs and I had the Filet Mignon. The food was good, but we canceled our other Pinnacle reservations since the hostess wants to seat us at the most undesirable tables and the tables in the restaurant are way too close together."

    "text": "Koningsdam, Mazatlan, Sunday, December 15, 2024\nWe were up before sunrise and the moon was a bright full moon.\nWe ordered room service for breakfast, scrambled eggs, sausage, yogurt, fruit and toast. We skipped the coffee.\nOur tour today is called Mini-Speedboat & All-Inclusive Beach Escape ($119 per person). Our meeting time was in the theater at 745am. We had about a 30 minute wait before our tour was called and there were 12 of us on this tour. The bus was open air (no windows) and it was a bit windy and chilly. It was mostly sunny in the morning with a temperature of 68F.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nAfter arriving at the El Cid Marina Resort we were given a rum punch welcome drink. Having a drink before driving a mini speed boat must be a Mexican thing. The top speed of the boat was probably 15 mph at most, so having a little buzz while boating makes up for the lack of speed. There were two parts to the mini speed boat tour, the first was a slow single file tour of the marina. Then we got to an area of the marina where we could go as fast as the boats could go. Driving the mini speed boats was fun. Seeing the houses and boats in the marina was interesting. All in all, it was kind of fun and different from the typical excursions.\nThis is one of the other mini speed boats.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nOur plan was to switch drivers at the halfway point, but Becky didn’t want to drive.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nThis part of the tour was the slow single file part along the residential area.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nAfter the boat tour we were allowed to use the beach and pool facilities of the resort. Lunch was served to us at our palapa. The food was good, we ate most of it, even though we weren’t that hungry. The drinks were included. Later we went for a swim in the resort pool. At 130pm we got back on the bus for the 40 minute ride back to the port.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nThe only item we didn’t care for were the chicken wings in BBQ sauce."

For breakfast I ordered something I haven’t tried before, the Asian Congee – rice porridge with ginger, tofu, chicken, scallions, boiled egg. This kind of looked like oatmeal. It was very spicy and good.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nIn the morning we attended another cooking demonstration, this time the dish was fish tacos. Then we attended another watercolor class and arrived about 30 minutes early. Like the watercolor class on the previous day, the class filled up about 20 minutes before the start and many people were turned away.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nWe had lunch in the Dutch cafe. I had the split pea soup, which was much better than on the first day. We shared a grilled ham and cheese sandwich and a basket of fries.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nAfter lunch we shared a Bossche Bol - a Dutch pastry, which is a large cream puff, filled with whipped cream and coated chocolate icing. Very messy and not my favorite. We cut the ball in half to share, but I only had one bite.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nAt 1pm we attended a mixology class where we drank too much. The drinks were cosmos, lemon drop, manhattan and old fashion.\nFor dinner, Becky had the Port Braised Lamb Shank - butter bean puree and gremolata. She didn’t care too much for the Lamb shank.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nI had Fresh Rockfish with olives, onion, peppers, creamy mascarpone polenta and green beans. The fish was good.\n\n\n\ncaption"

We were on the first tender at 8am for the 15 minute ride to shore. The water was calm in the morning so the ride wasn’t too bad. Once ashore we made our way to the pedestrian walkway called Juan María de Salvatierra.

I’ve been working my way through the various breakfast options that are unique to Holland America Cruise Line. I have never tried herring in sour cream or even just herring, so I asked our waiter if he had had it before, he said, ‘I have never tried that one’. As you can see in the photo, the herring (small serving of gray fish next to the tomato) didn’t come in sour cream. I took a small bite of the herring, it was pickled with onions and it tasted like sweet bread and butter pickle chips. The fish was soft, so the texture and taste was like a mushy pickle. I made a small sandwich with the items on the plate, shared some of the ham with Becky and finished about half of the herring.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nThe ship docks at the port of Pichilingue, which is about 12 miles north of La Paz. We were on the 8:30 am bus and it took about 20 minutes to get to the city bus terminal. We didn’t have much planned for our visit other than to walk along the Malecon. There happened to be several streets that were blocked and set up with tents for vendors to sell Christmas items and souvenirs.\nHere are a few random photos from our walk.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\n\n\n\ncaption"

The tender operations started at 7am and the last tender back to the ship was at 12:30pm. So only a half day in port. A Carnival ship was also anchored in the bay a short distance from us.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nAt breakfast I’ve been making my way through the more exotic selections and for today’s choice I ordered two entrees. I wasn’t sure I would like or eat much of the Herring, so I ordered it as an afterthought. My first entree to arrive was the Kippered Herring - scrambled eggs, caramelized onions. I’ve never had Kippered Herring before, and it was OK. The fish was fried and definitely had a fishy smell. I probably would not order this one again.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nMy second entree was the Avocado Toast, Poached Egg – feta cheese, olive oil, whole wheat, arugula and cherry tomato salad. This was good and I would order it again. I ordered the poached eggs well done, otherwise they would come runny egg yolks and sometimes with the egg white not fully cooked.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nWe spent the morning by the main pool. At 10am I went to the spa for my hair cut appointment, $45 plus 18% service charge. My hair cut was good. A bit into the cutting I had to tell him to cut it shorter since he was being too conservative. What’s the point of getting a haircut if he’s only going to cut ¼ inch?\nFor lunch Becky ordered a hamburger from the Dive bar and I ordered a tuna sandwich from the deli.\nFor our dinner entrees, Becky ordered the pasta and I ordered the duck breast: Tangerine Glazed Duck Breast – wild rice potato pancake, red cabbage, snow peas. I’ve never had duck breast before and I didn’t care for the taste of the meat, I thought it tasted like liver. I only ate about half of the duck breast.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nBecky had the Ricotta and Spinach Tortellini – Arrabiata sauce, grilled vegetables. She liked her pasta. I tried to get her to have a taste of the duck, but she was not up for it. She didn’t believe me when I told her that it tasted like Lamb.\n\n\n\ncaption"

This was a nice breakfast and I would definitely order this again.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nAfter breakfast we went to listen to coffee with Alex, the cruise director.

He originally studied electronics in college and then went to the merchant marine academy when he thought we would give sailing a try. He started as a cadet on a cruise ship in 1992.\nLater we did some packing and after lunch we watched a movie. There was a carnival being held on the pool deck so we went to see what that was about.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nFor dinner Becky ordered the Lasagna and I ordered the fish. The Lasagna was really good.\n\n\n\ncaption\n\n\nAfter dinner we listened to the piano players in Billboards on Board. These are the two pianos that the signers play. Tonight was all requests. Here is a photo of the pianos when the lounge was empty. Most evenings we would listen to the signers for a while before going to bed.\n\n\n\ncaption"

Breakfast this morning was from a reduced menu. I suppose that on disembarkation day, since the breakfast service ends early only the items that are quicker to make are offered. We both ordered omelets. After breakfast we did our final packing and waited for the ship to call the first disembarkation group, which was Self Assist starting at 715am. At 730am we left the room.\nThe elevators going down to deck A were full. After waiting and only seeing full elevators, I pushed the up arrow button and a mostly empty elevator arrived. So we had to go up to go down. By 8am we were off the ship and at Customs and Border Protection facial recognition check point. Becky went through right away, but it took three tries of facial recognition before I got the green light.\nWe left the cruise terminal and walked across the street where I called Lyft to take us to the airport rental car terminal. The traffic was not too bad and we arrived home around 11:30 am."

    "text": "Becky and I are on an 11 day Mexican Riviera & Sea Of Cortez cruise. These emails are installments from my trip report.\nThis morning I picked up a rental car for our drive to San Diego. From my house it’s a 40 minute walk to Avis. The office opens at 9am and I was there about five minutes early. By the time the office opened at five minutes after the hour, there were three of us lined up and I was the first in line. It took about 20 minutes for the computers to get warmed up and for me to get my rental contract. The car I got this time was a Nissan Rogue. A decent car for a three hour drive south.\nI parked the car in the garage while we were still getting ready and when I moved the car out, I noticed that there were two small spots where oil was leaking, not a good sign. Later in the day, I got a message from Avis asking if I had found anything in the car. There was some trash and used tissues but no cooking pot, which the previous renter thought they had left in the car. The office was closed by the time I listened to my messages, so I called back on Monday.\nAfter loading our luggage into the car, we were on the road by 10:35 am for the 200 mile drive. We encountered a lot of stop and go traffic along Hwy-101 and I-405 near LAX. In Orange county the traffic also came to a stop for some large cardboard boxes and about five plastic Christmas tree stands scattered across three or four lanes. We stopped for lunch at Wendy’s. I gassed up the car at Costco in San Diego. This Costco has the smallest and most congested parking lot of any Costco that I’ve been to.\nOur hotel in San Diego is a Marriott Towneplace and not in the best location. This week there is a big convention in San Diego and most of the good hotels are fully booked. The hotel doesn’t have any parking for check-in. There is a $35 per day garage, but that makes no sense for someone just needing to park for a few minutes. I did find some 30 minute free parking on the street while we unloaded the car and checked in. After we dropped off our bags, I drove to the airport rental car terminal to return the car. From the terminal I walked about three blocks to the Middletown Station and took the San Diego Trolley downtown and from there a short walk back to the hotel. I did notice homeless people sleeping on the sidewalks near the Trolley stations and downtown at the civic center. Also there were some homeless riding the Trolley. The weather in San Diego was a bit on the cool side, partly cloudy with the temperature in the lower 60s.\nThe two restaurants that Becky had picked out for dinner were closed, so we bought sandwiches from Domino’s. Domino’s was convenient since it was across the street. We each had a ranch, chicken and bacon sandwich which we took back to our room to have with beer and chips that we had brought with us. The sandwich was toasted with a bit of melted cheese. It tasted good, but a bit on the dry side."

    "text": "San Diego - Monday\nI got up early and I showered first. The shower was very weak, just above a dribble. The shower only has a temperature knob and no flow adjustment. I took the shower head off, found some debris like some small pieces of leaves and a seed. So I cleaned the junk out and removed the flow restrictor o-ring for good measure. Now the flow is almost too strong. Before checking out of the hotel, I’ll need to replace the little rubber o-ring.\nHotel breakfast was decent. I would rate it above average as far as free hotel breakfasts go. The coffee was good and there was a good selection of toppings for oatmeal. I was able to put together a DIY trail mix made from walnuts, pumpkin seeds, cranberries and chocolate chips.\n\n\n\nBacon, egg ham and cheese on a croissant breakfast sandwich, spinach and Swiss cheese crustless quiche.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hotel has maid service every other day and since we are staying for two nights our room will not get made up. So after breakfast Becky called the front desk for a clean set of towels and a box of Kleenex.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaesar speaks R2D2 and made boobs and beeps similar to the Star Wars robot.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe hotel has a Bluetooth beacon near the work desk. I’ve never seen one of these before. According to the ‘relay’ web page (https://relaypro.com/), this can be used by the hotel to track staff and provide guest services. I suppose in other words - to spy on guests and staff. Edward Snowden would be covering this with tape and aluminum foil.\n\n\nThe day started off with cloudy skies, then cleared up to mostly sunny. The high 63F and the winds were to 10 mph. In the shade with the slight breeze, it was a little chilly.\nAround 10:30 am we left the hotel and walked two blocks to the Trolley station and bought two one way tickets. My plan was to purchase an all day ticket, but they were not available at this ticket machine. While we were waiting for the next Trolley a security guard said hello and asked to see our tickets and we weren’t even on the train. The ride to Old Town took about 20 minutes.\nLast year when we visited Old Town, many of the shops were closed. Today, they all seemed open. The place was decorated for Christmas and many of the shops were selling Christmas items and decorations. We stopped into an olive oil shop and tasted some of the oil and balsamic vinegar. I would have bought some of the olive spread, but I didn’t want to carry it onto the cruise ship.\n\nThe doors to the Immaculate Conception Catholic Church were open so we stopped in to look at the church. They were having a service so we sat in the back for a few minutes.\n\n\n\nToday was the Feast of the Immaculate Conception and there were about 20 people attending the service.\n\n\nWe had lunch at a restaurant called Fred’s Tacos y Tequila. Becky had enchiladas and I had a burrito. The food was good and filled us up. This was going to be a late lunch or early dinner for us.\nAfter lunch we took the trolley to Little Italy and walked to the San Diego Maritime Museum. We had an AARP two for one coupon which Becky had printed before we left home. We spent about two hours exploring the ships. The Maritime Museum has five ships that can be viewed. The museum was not busy and we had the ships to ourselves for the most part. The Star of India and the submarine USS Dolphin were the most interesting to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe San Diego Trolley is a light rail service that connects San Diego’s downtown with East County, UC San Diego, South Bay and the Mexico border.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStar of India is the world’s oldest active sailing ship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOriginally built in 1970 as HMS Rose, this tall ship was designed as a replica of an 18th-century Royal Navy frigate based on original Admiralty plans. She spent decades as a sail training vessel and attraction before undergoing extensive modifications for the Academy Award-winning film Master and Commander: The Far Side of the World.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe HMS Rose’s gun deck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCommissioned in 1968, USS Dolphin (AGSS-555) set records as the deepest-diving operational submarine, reaching depths of over 3,000 feet.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInside the USS Dolphin.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe decided to walk back to our hotel, which was about a one mile walk over most flat ground. My step count for the day was 15,265 which Fit Bit says is 7.23 miles. Later we finished some of the snacks we had brought since we didn’t want to take them on to the cruise ship."

    "text": "San Diego - Tuesday\nI woke at 6am to shower and do some packing. Breakfast selections this morning were sausage patties, scrambled eggs and jalapeno poppers. The jalapeno poppers weren’t that good. The sausage patties and eggs were typical hotel breakfast food. In other words, edible but nothing to rave about. There was one family with small kids in the breakfast dining room area. The other guests seem to be mainly business people.\nI put the flow restrictor o-ring back into the shower head and the shower flow with the restrictor is much better than it was before.\nToday is embarkation day. Our cruise is an 11 day Mexican Riviera and Sea of Cortez cruise.\nThis is the route of our cruise, six ports and four sea days.\n\n\n\nThe ship’s cruise map.\n\n\nThe plan this morning was to leave our room at 10:40 am, check out of the hotel, call Lyft and wait in the lobby for the driver to show up. This should get us to the port around 11:00 am. The cruise check-in time printed on our tickets is for 12:00 noon. It says 12:00 noon for everybody so I wonder if the whole ship is going to show up at noon. I think the terminal actually opens at 11:00 am.\nWe left our room around 10:30 to check out. I called the Lyft and we had to wait about 10 minutes before he showed up. The drive to the cruise terminal took about 10 minutes where we unloaded our bags, walked right into the terminal, went through security and we were at the check-in counter a minute or two later. From there we walked directly onto the ship. We didn’t have to wait in any lines.\nOur first stop was at the restaurant reservation desk where we made reservations for the Italian restaurant for two nights and lunch at the steakhouse for two days. These are paid venues and we’ll use some of our on board credit to pay for these charges.\nWe went to our room to pick up our key cards and dropped off our carry-on bags. We needed our room keys in order to order drinks at lunch. Some guy in the elevator said that the rooms aren’t ready yet but we said we were going to go pick up our room keys. Our room was ready. We dropped off our bags and used the bathroom.\nWe stopped by the Neptune lounge to talk with the concierge and check out what they had to offer in the lounge. The assistant concierge gave us the orientation and explained what we could expect and what services they offer.\n\n\n\nThe lounge is open from 7 am until 8 pm. Coffee, tea, wine, beer, sodas and snacks are available anytime the lounge is open.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe chocolate truffles (chocolate balls on the right) are good with coffee.\n\n\nThen we went to the Dutch Cafe for lunch. I got a ham and cheese sandwich, split pea soup, a side of fries and a Belgian beer. Becky ordered a ham and cheese sandwich, side of fries and the same type of beer.\n\n\n\nHam and cheese sandwich, split pea soup, a side of fries and a Belgian beer.\n\n\nAfter lunch we want to explore the ship. We stopped by the spa and I made an appointment for a haircut later in the cruise.\nAt 1 pm we went to our assigned muster station to check in. We were told to watch the safety video on the TV back in our room.\nWe went back to the lounge to make a cup of coffee with their fancy coffee machine and then back to the room to see if our luggage had arrived. Only mine was there so I unpacked.\nOur cabin stewards stop by to say hello and give us an orientation. I mentioned that the water in the coffee maker was low and he said we can fill the reservoir from the sink. On other Cruise lines the butler does this for us. Here we will need to fend for ourselves.\nFor a change I was able to do all of my unpacking while we were waiting for Becky’s suitcase to arrive.\nWhen Becky’s suitcase arrived she was able to do some unpacking while making a mess of the room and moving many of my clothes out of her way. Our suitcases fit under the bead and we can roll them out if we need anything stored on there.\nLater we attended a raffle in the shops, but we didn’t win, but the prize was a nice selection of various Holland branded merchandise. We looked around at the merchandise to see what we were going to spend our credit on. I think I might buy a sweater or a shirt. Becky also found a shirt she liked. We will make these purchases later in the cruise once we see how our budget is working out.\nOur non-refundable on board credit amount is $1050. This is a lot more than we usually get. The credit comes from a combination of - a Cruise line promotion, something called Goodwill future cruise credit, AARP, “Welcome home” and Shareholder’s benefit. We hope about half of the credit can be applied to the daily service charge, as on previous cruises ($19 per person per day). We will monitor our room statement every day to make sure that the charges are being applied as we think they should. We also have a separate shore excursion credit and we will take a couple of shore excursions.\nAt 4pm we went back to the room to get ready and change for dinner.\nFor dinner Becky ordered the Chicken and corn soup: smoked chicken, roasted corn, scallions and bell pepper. This was a clear broth soup, which she said would be good if it was snowing outside and she had the cold. Her main dish was Beef Pot Roast. She said this was good.\n\n\n\nBeef Pot Roast: roasted parsnip and root vegetables, potato smash.\n\n\nI ordered a Classic Caesar salad to start. For my main course I ordered Mahi Mahi Diablo. This was good and with just enough spice to make it interesting.\n\n\n\nMahi Mahi Diablo: Cilantro rice, guajillo chilies, chipotle, tomatoes.\n\n\nAt 7pm we went to the Neptune lounge reception. Only six people attended. It was just a repeat of the orientation we got earlier in the day but with a glass of wine or champagne.\nLater we listened to the signers in the venue called Billboards. Here there are two pianos and two singers/players to entertain the guests with songs, usually following some theme. Tonight’s theme was “Hot 100” for the first set. Later in the evening the theme changed to “Hot R&B” and then requests for the last set of the evening."

    "text": "Sea Day - Wednesday\nToday was a sea day, one of two, on our way to Manzanillo. We were up early. I tried to make a cup of coffee with the coffee maker in our room, but it seems that the machine only makes small cups of espresso. Later I asked our room steward about making coffee and he said to call room service if I wanted coffee. Behind the coffee machine I found a bluetooth speaker, so now we can have some music in our room.\nWe attended an event called “Coffee with Alex”, who is the cruise director – we only stayed for a minute. She was interviewing the gift shop manager, who was from Zimbabwe. We then went to the art studio for a class. It was a good thing we arrived early since the class filled up and people were turned away.\n\n\n\nThe art project for today was a watercollor jelly fish.\n\n\nAs we were walking around the ship Becky found two ducks. Here is one of them.\n\n\n\nWe found a cruise duck. “Cruise ducks” refer to a popular and lighthearted tradition among cruise passengers where small rubber ducks are hidden around the ship for others to find. It’s essentially a ship-wide game of hide-and-seek.\n\n\nFor lunch we went to a Mexican brunch being offered in the main dining room. There was a signature drink suggested with the menu called the Pamplemousse Martini, so we ordered two of them.\n\n\n\nPamplemousse Martini: De Lijn Gin, grapefruit, lemon, St Germain liqueur. This was very tasty and not too sweet. The grapefruit and gin taste nice together.\n\n\nOn this cruise we have Holland’s version of the drink package. We each get 15 drinks per day, which seems like a lot, but bottled water and specialty coffee is included. We can’t combine our allotment of drinks so we need to drink responsibility and keep track of our drink count each day. Towards the end of each day, if we need water for a port day, we will pick up several cans of water to fill up our water bottles.\n\n\n\nPulled pork Carnitas Taco: soft tortilla, shredded jack cheese, avocado, cilantro, mango salsa. These were good and the mango salsa was very tasty.\n\n\nWe attended afternoon tea. We sat with a solo traveler from San Diego. She’s a retired judge advocate for the County and has been a widow for a few years. She is traveling with a friend she’s known from high school. She has been on more than 70 cruises.\n\n\n\nAfternoon tea setup.\n\n\nFor dinner, Becky had lamb chops for her main course and I had the Fresh Yellow Fin Sole Fillet. After dinner we attended the Captain’s welcome toast in the main theater. We stayed to watch the show in the theater, but we had seen it before and it was not very interesting. The show was just music and dancers dancing. So we left after about 15 minutes. Out on the lido deck there was a movie by the pool called - The Journey: A Musical Special from Andrea Bocelli. Popcorn was served during the movie. The movie is a few years old, and we stayed for part of the movie. The audio was slightly out of sync with the video and it was hard to follow the dialog."

    "text": "Sea Day - Thursday\nToday is the second sea day on our way south. The temperature has warmed up a bit and the air is more humid. I made espresso with the machine in our room and it was not good. The temperature was not hot enough to dissolve the small amount of sugar I added and the taste was very bitter.\nAfter breakfast we attended the morning coffee chat with the cruise director Alex. She was interviewing the art auctioneer, which was kind of interesting.\nThen we attended a cooking demonstration in the main theater. It was kind of like a cooking channel show. The cruise director interviewed the chef and would ask him questions about the food, his life and career while he chopped and cooked. The demonstration was interesting and entertaining.\n\n\n\nThe chef cooked Grouper with rice pilaf and salsa picante.\n\n\nLunch today was in the Pinnacle Grill, the paid steakhouse. Lunch is served here on sea days for $20 per person plus 18%. To start we ordered cocktails. Becky had the Ritz Cocktail - maraschino liqueur, Courvoisier, Cointreau, lemon, Champagne. I had the Sao Paulo, the ingredients sounded good and I thought I’d give it a try. It was OK, but I wouldn’t get it again. Becky liked the Ritz Cocktail.\n\n\n\nSao Paulo: Cachaca, coconut lime, passionfruit, vanilla.\n\n\nWe both had the wedge salad, Becky had the Lamb chops, roasted baby beets with blue cheese and Key lime pie. I had the Sea Bass, Asparagus with Hollandaise sauce and Creme brulee. I had to send the sea bass back to be cooked a bit more. After that, it was good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon we attended trivia but we sat off to the side since it was packed. The theme was travel and from clues you needed to guess the city. We knew about half of the answers.\nSince today was another sea day, tea was served at 3pm which we ordered to be served in our room and we enjoyed tea on our balcony. We were on the shaded side of the ship and the temperature was 70F. So it was nice to have afternoon tea out in the fresh air.\n\n\n\nTea setup in our cabin.\n\n\nAfter dinner we attended the show in the main theater which was by the performer Tyler Bryce – his show combined comedy, singing and celebrity impressions. The show was entertaining."

    "text": "Manzanillo - Friday\nWoke early, showered and went to get coffee from the Neptune lounge at 7am. Becky skipped coffee since today we have a shore excursion with a long bus ride. For breakfast, Becky had an omelet and I had an Indian breakfast entre with two sausages on the side since this is a Indian vegetarian breakfast. I’ve had this on previous cruises and I like it; it’s a bit on the spicy end of the spectrum.\n\n\n\nAloo Masala and egg bhurji with paratha rava dosa.\n\n\nToday we arrived in Manzanillo around 930am and the ship was cleared by 10am. Our tour is called “Manzanillo’s Many Talents: Salt, Fruit & Clay Bricks”. The tour bus took us through the surrounding country. Coconut, mango, papaya, sugar cane and bananas are grown here. Our first stop was to a sea salt production facility; then onto a mango farm. The third stop was to a brick making facility. The final stop was to a little beach town called Balneario El Paraiso, where we had a snack and sampled some of the local fruit. The tour lasted about five hours, cost was $70 per person and we used some of our shore excursion credit to pay for the ticket. The tour was decent and it was interesting to see the tropical farms.\nHere are a few pictures from the excursion.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter a few stages of concentration, the salt brine is pumped into these shallow plastic lined ponds to sit for a day until the salt falls out of the solution.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe salt is harvested with brooms.Here I am sweeping up some of the salt.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThis is jackfruit. It is very sweet and has a nice texture. I had some at the lunch stop and it was good.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bricks are hand made at this place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA small plate of food was served at a beach side resturant. The rolled up tostadas were filled with slices of cooked potatoes."

We had our first cup of coffee in the Neptune lounge. Then we stopped by the Dutch Cafe for another cup of coffee. I decided to order an espresso (made from a legitimate espresso machine) and Becky ordered a latte. For breakfast Becky ordered buckwheat pancakes and I ordered the Pan Asian Breakfast.\n\n\n\nPan Asian Breakfast: hot miso soup, steamed white rice, tamagoyaki and broiled salmon.\n\n\nWe spent the day by the main pool. The retractable roof was open and I sat at a table in the shade where I was able to read my book. Becky moved back and forth between a lounger in the sun and one in the shade. The water in the pool wasn’t too cold as it can sometimes be. By mid morning the ship was mostly empty since the majority of passengers had gone ashore. For lunch we ordered a pizza using the ship’s app. The app also informed us when the order was ready, which was very convenient. We ordered a pizza called the Tribeca. I can’t remember when I last had a pizza, maybe six months ago. The pizza was good. Around 2pm passengers started to return and the loungers around the pool started to fill up. A bit later we went back to our room and sat on our balcony.\n\n\n\nTribeca: roasted chicken, red onion, cilantro, barbecue sauce, smoked mozzarella.\n\n\nDinner was at the Pinnacle Grill. Becky had the Short Ribs and I had the Filet Mignon. The food was good, but we canceled our other Pinnacle reservations since the hostess wants to seat us at the most undesirable tables and the tables in the restaurant are way too close together."

We skipped the coffee.\nOur tour today is called Mini-Speedboat & All-Inclusive Beach Escape ($119 per person). Our meeting time was in the theater at 745am. We had about a 30 minute wait before our tour was called and there were 12 of us on this tour. The bus was open air (no windows) and it was a bit windy and chilly. It was mostly sunny in the morning with a temperature of 68F.\n\n\n\nOur tour bus was kind of open air and a bit chilly in the morning.\n\n\nAfter arriving at the El Cid Marina Resort we were given a rum punch welcome drink. Having a drink before driving a mini speed boat must be a Mexican thing. The top speed of the boat was probably 15 mph at most, so having a little buzz while boating makes up for the lack of speed. There were two parts to the mini speed boat tour, the first was a slow single file tour of the marina. Then we got to an area of the marina where we could go as fast as the boats could go. Driving the mini speed boats was fun. Seeing the houses and boats in the marina was interesting. All in all, it was kind of fun and different from the typical excursions.\n\n\n\nThis is one of the other mini speed boats.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur plan was to switch drivers at the halfway point, but Becky didn’t want to drive.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis part of the tour was the slow single file part along the residential area.\n\n\nAfter the boat tour we were allowed to use the beach and pool facilities of the resort. Lunch was served to us at our palapa. The food was good, we ate most of it, even though we weren’t that hungry. The drinks were included. Later we went for a swim in the resort pool. At 130pm we got back on the bus for the 40 minute ride back to the port.\n\n\n\nOur lunch.\n\n\nThe only item we didn’t care for were the chicken wings in BBQ sauce."

It was very spicy and good.\n\n\n\nAsian Congee: rice porridge with ginger, tofu, chicken, scallions, boiled egg.\n\n\nIn the morning we attended another cooking demonstration, this time the dish was fish tacos.

I have never tried herring in sour cream or even just herring, so I asked our waiter if he had had it before, he said, ‘I have never tried that one’. As you can see in the photo, the herring (small serving of gray fish next to the tomato) didn’t come in sour cream. I took a small bite of the herring, it was pickled with onions and it tasted like sweet bread and butter pickle chips. The fish was soft, so the texture and taste was like a mushy pickle. I made a small sandwich with the items on the plate, shared some of the ham with Becky and finished about half of the herring.\n\n\n\nuropean Cold Breakfast Plate: sliced ham, Gouda cheese, herring in sour cream, mustard, pickles, red beats, boiled egg, Boston lettuce, tomato, cucumber and crusty break.\n\n\nThe ship docks at the port of Pichilingue, which is about 12 miles north of La Paz. We were on the 8:30 am bus and it took about 20 minutes to get to the city bus terminal. We didn’t have much planned for our visit other than to walk along the Malecon.

A Carnival ship was also anchored in the bay a short distance from us.\n\n\n\nTender boats in the bay of Cabo San Lucas.\n\n\nAt breakfast I’ve been making my way through the more exotic selections and for today’s choice I ordered two entrees. I wasn’t sure I would like or eat much of the Herring, so I ordered it as an afterthought. My first entree to arrive was the Kippered Herring and it was OK. The fish was fried and definitely had a fishy smell. I probably would not order this one again.\n\n\n\nKippered Herring: scrambled eggs, caramelized onions.\n\n\nMy second entree was the Avocado Toast with Poached Egg. This was good and I would order it again. I ordered the poached eggs well done, otherwise they would come runny egg yolks and sometimes with the egg white not fully cooked.\n\n\n\nAvocado Toast, Poached Egg: feta cheese, olive oil, whole wheat, arugula and cherry tomato salad.\n\n\nWe spent the morning by the main pool. At 10am I went to the spa for my hair cut appointment, $45 plus 18% service charge. My hair cut was good. A bit into the cutting I had to tell him to cut it shorter since he was being too conservative. What’s the point of getting a haircut if he’s only going to cut ¼ inch?\nFor lunch Becky ordered a hamburger from the Dive bar and I ordered a tuna sandwich from the deli.\nFor our dinner entrees, Becky ordered the pasta and I ordered the duck breast. I’ve never had duck breast before and I didn’t care for the taste of the meat, I thought it tasted like liver. I only ate about half of the duck breast.\n\n\n\nTangerine Glazed Duck Breast: wild rice potato pancake, red cabbage, snow peas.\n\n\nBecky had the Ricotta and Spinach Tortellini. She liked her pasta. I tried to get her to have a taste of the duck, but she was not up for it. She didn’t believe me when I told her that it tasted like Lamb.\n\n\n\nRicotta and Spinach Tortellini: Arrabiata sauce, grilled vegetables."

I suppose that on disembarkation day, since the breakfast service ends early only the items that are quicker to make are offered. We both ordered omelets.

Becky went through right away, but it took three tries of facial recognition before I got the green light.\nWe left the cruise terminal and walked across the street where I called Lyft to take us to the airport rental car terminal.

    "text": "Travel to San Diego - Sunday\nBecky and I are on an 11 day Mexican Riviera & Sea Of Cortez cruise. These emails are installments from my trip report.\nThis morning I picked up a rental car for our drive to San Diego. From my house it’s a 40 minute walk to Avis. The office opens at 9am and I was there about five minutes early. By the time the office opened at five minutes after the hour, there were three of us lined up and I was the first in line. It took about 20 minutes for the computers to get warmed up and for me to get my rental contract. The car I got this time was a Nissan Rogue. A decent car for a three hour drive south.\nI parked the car in the garage while we were still getting ready and when I moved the car out, I noticed that there were two small spots where oil was leaking, not a good sign. Later in the day, I got a message from Avis asking if I had found anything in the car. There was some trash and used tissues but no cooking pot, which the previous renter thought they had left in the car. The office was closed by the time I listened to my messages, so I called back on Monday.\nAfter loading our luggage into the car, we were on the road by 10:35 am for the 200 mile drive. We encountered a lot of stop and go traffic along Hwy-101 and I-405 near LAX. In Orange county the traffic also came to a stop for some large cardboard boxes and about five plastic Christmas tree stands scattered across three or four lanes. We stopped for lunch at Wendy’s. I gassed up the car at Costco in San Diego. This Costco has the smallest and most congested parking lot of any Costco that I’ve been to.\nOur hotel in San Diego is a Marriott Towneplace and not in the best location. This week there is a big convention in San Diego and most of the good hotels are fully booked. The hotel doesn’t have any parking for check-in. There is a $35 per day garage, but that makes no sense for someone just needing to park for a few minutes. I did find some 30 minute free parking on the street while we unloaded the car and checked in. After we dropped off our bags, I drove to the airport rental car terminal to return the car. From the terminal I walked about three blocks to the Middletown Station and took the San Diego Trolley downtown and from there a short walk back to the hotel. I did notice homeless people sleeping on the sidewalks near the Trolley stations and downtown at the civic center. Also there were some homeless riding the Trolley. The weather in San Diego was a bit on the cool side, partly cloudy with the temperature in the lower 60s.\nThe two restaurants that Becky had picked out for dinner were closed, so we bought sandwiches from Domino’s. Domino’s was convenient since it was across the street. We each had a ranch, chicken and bacon sandwich which we took back to our room to have with beer and chips that we had brought with us. The sandwich was toasted with a bit of melted cheese. It tasted good, but a bit on the dry side."

    "text": "Embarkation, Sunday, November 10, 2024\nToday is embarkation day for our seven day cruise to the Mexican Riviera on the NCL Bliss. We booked this cruise kind of last minute based on a promotion and a price reduction. Not too long after booking, we were able to change our cabin to to a nicer one for no additional cost, since prices had fallen even more since we booked. All we had to do is call our travel agent and requested a move to the new room. We went from a forward facing cabin to an aft facing cabin, which has a nicer balcony. NCL does not offer refunds for price drops (after final payment), instead you get a future cruise credit, so we opted for a nicer room.\nWe left Ventura around 8:30am for the 80 mile drive to San Pedro. Sunday morning traffic was light and we cruised south on US-101, I-405 and I-5, averaging 75 mph until we got near LAX where all five south bound lanes came to a complete stop for about two minutes. Down the road we didn’t see a wreak or any indication of what caused the traffic to stop. After that the traffic was back up to the normal speed, which is probably more like 80+ mph, since most cars are going faster than me.\nAt the port, the parking lot was mostly full and since we thought that I would need to park on the far side of the lot, I dropped Becky off close to the terminal and drove off in search of a place to park. As luck would have it, after driving about 50 feet, I spotted an open spot. I unloading our remaining luggage and took note of where I parked the car. Then I went off to catch up with Becky. The lines inside the terminal were short and Becky had already made it through check-in and was in the waiting area when I caught up with her.\nWe were able to board about 30 minutes after arriving in the waiting area. I had a cup of coffee and a cookie while waiting. While waiting we said hello to the Assistant General Manager, Marites, who was walking through the lobby of the terminal. A few minutes later one of the valets came up to Becky and I and asked if we were ready to board. We were given a personal escort onto the ship about five minuets before anyone else. First time that has happened; usually we are in one of the priority boarding groups with about 20 to 50 other passengers. Later we found out that Marites had arranged that for us.\nThe valet took us to our room so we could drop off our carry on bags. Our cabin steward was cleaning our balcony when we arrived and when he was done, he came inside to gave us the normal first day room orientation. Then Becky did some unpacking before we went out to sign up for some of the events. We made reservations for two shows and signed up for the Latitudes wine tasking and Latitudes mixology event.\n\n\n\nHaving some wine while waiting for lunch to be served.\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of the parking lot from our lunch table, I can see my car. There were no other ships in port today and the lot was pretty full. On previous embarkation days there has been two ships in port with lots of passengers coming and going. So today there was not as many disembarking passengers freeing up parking spots.\n\n\nWe had lunch in Haven dining room. Becky had shrimp scampi, I had a Cobb salad and we shared mushroom flat bread.\n\n\n\nShrimp scampi - angel hair pasta, zucchini, white wine garlic sauce\n\n\n\n\n\nMushroom Flatbread - shitake, cremini, porcini, button, fontina cheese sauce, micro basil. This was kind of like a mini pizza.\n\n\n![Cobb salad - grilled chicken breast, bacon, hard boiled eggs, romaine, tomatoes, avocado, Roquefort w/ thousand island dressing]](IMG_20241110_122826436_HDR.jpg)\nWe skipped dessert, but we did order carrot cake, served only at lunch to have with this evening’s dinner. Our plan was to visit the buffet to see what was being offered on the first day. I like the Indian food in the buffet and Becky wanted a dessert only available in the buffet on embarkation. The buffet is very popular on the first day and it’s usually very crowded. Becky found the Pecan Cake that she likes and I went to look at the Indian food.\n\n\n\nFor my second lunch, I sampled some of the Indian food from the Indian section of the buffet. My plate with some of the selections - Basmati rice, Dal, Dhingri Mutter, Mixed Vegetable Curry, Chicken Saagwala. The Indian food on the ship is very good and I usually try to have some at least once per cruise.\n\n\nBack to the room for sail away and have a glass of the champaign that came with the room. The weather was perfect, mostly sunny, 70F and no wind. We sat on the balcony until the ship had made it to the open ocean. Then we got changed for drinks and dinner.\n\n\n\nSail away drinks.\n\n\n\n\n\nLeaving San Pedro.\n\n\n\n\n\nPredinner cocktails. Becky’s on the left is a French raspberry martini and my drink is a Negroni (sweet vermouth, Campari and gin)\n\n\nWe had dinner in the Haven dinning room. Becky had surf and turf and I had one crab cake (two crab cakes are just too much).\n\n\n\nBecky’s starter was Shrimp Louie - Romaine Lettuce, Tomato, Piccalilli, Thousand Island Dressing\n\n\n\n\n\nMy starter was deviled eggs Lobster Deviled Eggs - Mustard, Celery, Relish, Parmesan Crisp, I have had these several times and they are good.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy second was soup Butternut Squash Soup - with Duck Confit. Tonight’s soup was better than I remember. Maybe the seasoning was changed; tonight the soup was excellent.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur waiter removing Becky’s lobster from the shell.\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky’s main was Surf and Turf - Lobster Tail, Filet Mignon, Sauteed Spinach, Silky Pomme Puree (a creamier twist on mashed potatoes, in place of a Baked Potato), Bearnaise Sauce. She ordered the steak medium, but it came a bit to rare even for her.\n\n\n\n\n\nMy main was Crab Cakes - Pommery Mustard Sauce, Homemade Coleslaw, Golden French Fries. One crab cake is more than enough for me. I usually order this entree once per cruise. The coleslaw was good and goes well with the crab cake. I usually skip the french fries, but tonight I decided to have some extra carbs.\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrot Cake was not on the dinner menu, but if requested during lunch, it can be served at dinner. The Carrot cake is good and has a cream cheese frosting and a thin slice of candied carrot on top. We ordered coffee with the cake.\n\n\nShow was the Beatles\n\n\n\nAfter dinner we attended a performance called The Beatles Experience which is the popular songs from the early years. The band members are from Argentina and usually have different people every time we cruise. Tonight’s singers were good.

    "text": "Sea day - Monday, November 11, 2024\nI was up at 5:30am. After my shower, I made a cup of coffee with the Nepresso machine in our room and worked on my laptop. A Nespresso machine is a type of coffee maker that uses pre-portioned, single-use coffee capsules (also known as pods) to brew espresso and coffee. I’m not a fan of the coffee from the Nepresso machine, because the taste of the coffee, but it’s convenient. After Becky got ready, we walked from the back of the ship to the front and then up six flights of stairs to the Haven compound to have another cup of coffee in the lounge. The coffee from the self service machine is really good. I bring my Nissan thermal mug which will hold one Americano and one Cafe Latte. I had a few slices of pineapple, watermelon, mango and cantaloupe as my pre-breakfast. Becky had a cup of Cappuccino and a pastry. Then we went to the dining room for our real breakfast. I had a Poached Egg Avocado Toast and Becky had a Ham and Cheese omelet.\nAfter breakfast we attended morning trivia.\n\n\n\nThe main atrium of the Bliss. A lot of passengers hang out here. This this the area where morning trivia is held.\n\n\nWe got a score of 15 out of 20 and tied with three other teams and received a deck of playing cards for winning. Here are some of the questions with answers that we didn’t know. In which year did the British start using the decimal currency? Answer: 1971 Where in the world can you find the worlds longest street? Answer: Toronto, Canada How many strings does a cello have? Answer: 4 What was the first Woman’s magazine called? Answer: Ladies Mercury Which legendary king was killed at the Battle of Camelford? Answer: King Arthur\nAfter trivia we talked with Mike and Tanya for a while. We met them on a cruise a few years ago.\nWe have $200 of non-refundable on board credit that we need to spend. In the gift shop, which is duty free, we bought: Jack Daniels Tennessee Honey, Baileys Expresso and Grand Marnier. We still need to spend $89.\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon I tried this Bourbon. This is 1792 and is a brand of Kentucky straight bourbon whiskey produced by the Barton 1792 Distillery in Bardstown, Kentucky. This is a premium bourbon, known for being a “high-rye” bourbon. I thoght it was OK.\n\n\nTonight was the Latitude party which started at 6pm. We arrived about 10 minutes early to met up with Mike and Tanya. The doors opened promptly at 6pm and we had a chance to say hello to the captain and senior staff. Our friend Ivan, the chief engineer was home on vacation so we met his alternate, a nice guy from Serbia. There are six ambassadors on board and we had reserved seats up front for us. I sat next to a lady named Kathy who cruises I think cruises for about 30 weeks a year. She liked to talk about all the great cruise deals she is getting.\nMike, Tanya, Becky and I left the Latitude party about 630pm to walk upstairs to the Haven party which started at 7pm. While we were waiting for the party to start, Becky, Tanya and Mike had Raspberry Martinis. Then Grace and William came into the lounge. We had met them on a cruise about a year ago. After greeting the Captain and staff we had fun talking to Mike, Tanya, William and Grace. Kathy who was at the latitude party arrived and said hello. I had encourage her to attend. She was reluctant since she didn’t know anyone. I said, now you know us, we can talk and you can leave when you want. At least she would know for the next cruise if she wanted to attend. Becky talked to Kathy for awhile and then the GM sec came to talk to Kathy. After awhile I asked Kathy what she thought of the party and she said that she probably wouldn’t attend again.\nAfter the Haven party wound down, Becky and I went to have a late dinner. Becky had Lobster bisque, rack of lamb. I had pork belly, trout. For desert we had a scoop of ice cream.\n\n\n\nBecky’s main was Pancetta Wrapped Lamb Chops - Roasted Potatoes, Green Beans, Rosemary Jus\n\n\n\n\n\nMy main was Pan-Seared Steelhead Trout - Beluga Lentils, Sautéed Broccolini, Vierge Sauce. Tonight I though the trout was better than I remembered. It came with some pico de gallo on the side that I think is new.\n\n\nWe each had a small scoop of ice cream for dessert. Since it was late in the evening, we skipped the coffee.\nFitbit step count for Monday: 15,764"

This is the point where the Pacific Ocean meets the Sea of Cortez.\n\n\nWe spend the day up on the Haven sun deck, which we had pretty much to ourselves.\nWe had dinner at Ocean Blue, with Grace and William, a retired couple we met on last year on a cruise. Grace retired from Kaiser Permamente health care. They grew up in Taiwan. After dinner we went to the theater to watch a new show called Icons.

Today we went to the ship’s library to look for a note that Sabrina and Michaela left for us tucked in a book when they cruised on the ship to Alaska this summer. I originally left them a note in the book which they found and in turn they left me a note to find the next time I was on the ship.

In case you didn’t know Cruise ducks are these little rubber ducks that people hide around the ship for other people to find and the ducks have tags with the date of the sailing and the names of the people who left them.\n\n\n\n\n\nHaven bar staff.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the evening we listened to some music at an event called Bandoake and is a form of live entertainment that combines the concept of karaoke with a live band. Instead of singing along to a pre-recorded instrumental track played through a machine, participants get to perform with a professional, live band playing the music in real time.\n\n\nFitbit step count for Wednesday: 11,192"

    "text": "This is a map of our route. The first stop was in Oranjestad. From there we traveled counter clockwise.\nThis post documents our 12 day cruise on Oceania Allura, which took us to some incredible islands, starting with the ABC islands in the Dutch Caribbean. First up was Oranjestad, Aruba, known for its stunning white-sand beaches, followed by Willemstad, Curacao, which has those beautiful, colorful Dutch colonial buildings lining the harbor. Next, we visited Kralendijk, Bonaire, which is a paradise for snorkeling and scuba diving. After the Dutch islands, we head to a few of the more lush, volcanic islands. We stopped at St. George’s, Grenada, which is famous for its spices and called the Spice Isle. Then it was Castries, St. Lucia, known for the peaks of the Pitons rising out of the sea. The itinerary also included a visit to Gustavia, St. Barts. Our last island stop was Tortola in the British Virgin Islands.\nOn previous trips I’ve sent out a daily email. On this trip, I did something different - I posted trip reports to Blogger. I was able to write and post something every day. I didn’t bring my laptop, but instead I used my phone to write my emails; either using my finger to peck at the screen or using voice typing (speech-to-text conversion). First, I recorded some notes about the day’s activities. After doing some basic editing and making corrections, I used Google Gemini to clean up the text to improve the flow and readability. Before leaving on this trip I did some testing of this procedure using trip notes from our previous cruise. The results required a bit of cleanup, but overall acceptable and much faster than pecking at the screen with my finger.\nAfter returning home, I took the emails and Blogger posts, added additional photos and made corrections to create this document."

    "text": "Fri, Nov 14 - Travel day, part 1\nOur flight from LAX to MIA was scheduled for a 6am departure, which required a very early start. Because recent news reports have highlighted issues with long lines, delays, and cancellations at airports nationwide, we decided to leave home much earlier than usual to ensure we had extra time, especially for any unexpected queues at the TSA security checkpoints.\nWe left home at 1:12am. Despite a light rain overnight leaving the roads wet, traffic on Highway 101 toward the Flyaway bus terminal in Van Nuys was light and flowing fast.\nWe arrived at the Van Nuys Flyaway at 2:04am. I had a 2am parking reservation and, after dropping Becky off at the curb, I parked the car on the second floor, not far from the elevator. There were a few open spaces scattered around.\nAt the bus terminal, we found about 25 people waiting, many of whom appeared to be airport workers. I had incorrectly assumed the next bus was at 2:30am; after checking the schedule, I learned the next scheduled departure was actually at 3am. However, we were able to board early at 2:50am.\nThe bus arrived at LAX Terminal 1 around 3:30am and we reached Terminal 4 at 3:45am.\nThe American Airlines bag check counter didn’t open until 3:50am. After checking our two bags, we proceeded directly to the TSA security checkpoint. Fortunately, the TSA PreCheck line was completely clear.\nWe arrived at our gate at 4:07am, giving us a little over an hour to wait before boarding.\nIt was still dark outside as we boarded the plane. Since we are seated in row 2, we were in the second boarding group, right after families with young children and those needing extra time or assistance. As I post this, we are on the plane, still at the gate, waiting for the remaining passengers to board and for the doors to close.\nThe flight to Miami is scheduled to take 4 hours and 47 minutes, with an estimated arrival time of 2:00 PM local time. The weather in Miami is expected to be 79°F and partly cloudy.\nFor the flight, Becky plans to watch a movie. The in-flight entertainment is streamed to personal devices, and since I don’t enjoy watching movies on my small phone screen, I decided to pass. Instead, I’ll be reading on my Kindle or listening to audiobooks. I checked out a couple of audiobooks from the library before leaving, and the 21-day loan period means I’ll have the whole trip to finish one. I’ll listen to a few minutes of the first chapter of each until I find one I like best."

I was pretty tired and ended up falling asleep while reading my book.\nFor breakfast, we both chose the three-cheese omelet with potato wedges. Unfortunately, the meal was marginal - it reminded me of a cheap frozen breakfast from the grocery store. The silver lining was the coffee, which I enjoyed with Baileys.\n\n\n\nBreakfast on the plane. The fruit and yogurt were good. I ate the omelet, but not the potato wedges since they were mushy.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking out the window at Texas below, somewhere north of Huston.\n\n\nAfter collecting our bags, we went outside to wait for the hotel shuttle. We must have just missed it, and because the shuttle only runs once an hour, we ended up waiting almost an hour. Next time, I think I’ll just call an Uber. We finally arrived at the hotel and were waiting in the check-in line by around 3:50pm.\nAfter unpacking, we took a ten-minute walk to a nearby Target to pick up some snacks. On the way back, we stopped at a small Mexican restaurant called Taqueria Los Potrillos Miami. We ordered some food to take back to the room; I had the carnitas burrito, and Becky had the chicken burrito. They were both really good!\nIt was a long day, so we turned in early."

Today was that layover day.\nI got up a little after six, after hitting the snooze button once on my alarm. After showering, I headed down to the lobby for a cup of coffee to bring back to the room. Becky got up a bit later.\nOnce we were both ready, we went down for the complimentary hotel breakfast. It was crowded in the lobby and there were people waiting around with their luggage. We think they were waiting for cruise ship transfers to the port or they had a very early flight arrival and we’re waiting for the 3pm hotel check in time.\nThe breakfast fare included scrambled eggs, waffles, oatmeal, and ham and egg croissant sandwiches. We both grabbed a croissant sandwich and some scrambled eggs, along with more coffee to take upstairs. Unfortunately, the scrambled eggs were cold, and the croissant bread was dry, but otherwise, it was a typical free hotel breakfast.\nThe hotel only services rooms on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, so we just asked the front desk to bring us a fresh set of towels.\nToday was mostly sunny with a temperature of 80F. We took a pleasant ten-minute walk from the hotel to the nearby Target. This store was noticeably nicer and larger than the ones near our home.\nIn the same shopping center, we discovered a store called Government Discount, an outlet open to the public that sells brand-name goods - like perfumes, home decor, and health and beauty products - at steep discounts. Becky found a few things to buy.\nWe picked up takeout for an early dinner at a nearby restaurant called the Latin Cafe. I had the Miami sandwich - Cuban Bread, Turkey Breast, Bolo Ham, Lettuce,Tomato, Swiss Cheese, Bacon & Mayo. And Becky had a Cubano - Cuban Bread, Bolo Ham, shredded Pork, Swiss Cheese minus the Pickles. Both sandwiches were pressed. While they were good, the burritos we had yesterday were definitely better.\nWe spent the evening relaxing with a cup of decaf coffee and a chocolate muffin (saved from breakfast) and playing card games: gin, rummy and kings on the corner. Becky won most of the hands.\nFinally we did some packing and organizing for tomorrow’s departure. We affixed the ship’s luggage tags to our check-in bags and discussed our morning departure time for the cruise port."

Becky had coffee and a muffin. We then packed our suitcases and were finished by 9am. Since we still had time to kill, we listened to an audiobook while waiting.\nA little after 10am, we gathered all our belongings, did a final room check, and went downstairs to check out of the hotel.\nOur cruise boarding pass indicated a noon boarding time, but since we had priority embarkation, we thought we could head to the terminal whenever we were ready. We decided 11am would be a good time to aim for, as we didn’t want to arrive too early and risk waiting outside if the terminal doors weren’t yet open.\nUsing the app on my phone, I arranged for Lyft to take us to the cruise terminal. The driver arrived about five minutes later, picking us up around 10:20am. Traffic to the port was light, but there was a lot of road construction. The freeway was closed, forcing us to take surface streets through the downtown area.\nWe arrived at the terminal around 10:45am and we were dropped off curbside. The stevedores were immediately available to take our two checked bags. At the terminal door, we had to show our passports and boarding passes before being allowed to proceed upstairs to the security checkpoint and waiting area.\nOur boarding passes were checked again, and we were directed to the seating area. The room was crowded, and with no empty seats, we just stood around. About five minutes later, they began boarding wheelchairs. As soon as the wheelchairs were through, people started rushing the line. We had to push our way forward since they were only allowing owners suites and President’s Circle guests to approach the counter for key cards.\nBy 11:10am, we were on the ship. We like to be onboard in time for lunch.\nThe first thing we did was go to the restaurant reservation desk to inquire about specialty dining availability. There were open spots, and we chose the Polo Grill, the Steak House. We secured a 6:30pm reservation for two at a non-sharing table.\nNext, we went to our muster station to check in. While there, Randy, a passenger we’ve met on two previous Oceania cruises, approached to say hello. We were surprised to see him, as we never expected him to be on this cruise. Later in the cruise we joined his trivia team.\nWe had a short wait before our rooms would be ready, so we went up to Wave’s Grill for lunch. I had the Surf & Turf Wagyu Burger, which had pieces of lobster on the burger. I took the lobster off to eat separately. The hamburger was good, but a little on the small side. Becky ate most of my fries. Becky had the baby shrimp cocktail salad with lobster on the side. She liked the lobster but didn’t care too much for the shrimp salad since it had too much mayo dressing on it.\n\n\n\nSurf & Turf Wagyu Burger - a Wagyu beef patty with lobster medallions and truffle mayonnaise.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfternoon snack of a latte and quiche.\n\n\nAt 11:30am an announcement was made over the PA system that the Owner’s, Vista, and Oceania suites were ready. We knew our rooms would be the next group to be called.\nAfter lunch, we went to the Barista’s coffee shop. I had a cappuccino and a small bacon and cheese quiche, while Becky had a latte with Bailey’s and a vanilla eclair. While we were relaxing, an announcement was made that our cabins were finally ready, around 1pm. We immediately made our way to the room.\nOur luggage was waiting in the hallway. Unpacking on the first day is a little like a game of Tetris; we had to find spots for our clothes. The drawers often aren’t deep or large enough for a lot of items, and some are too small to hold my packing cubes. I usually just leave my clothes in the packing cubes, which makes the whole process much easier.\nOnce most of our belongings were put away and our empty suitcases were stored under the bed or in the closet, we went out to explore the ship.\nAt 5pm we went to Martini’s Bar for a pre-dinner cocktail. I ordered a drink called Sir Connery. It was an interesting, though slightly sweet and dessert-like drink, and probably not one I’d get again. Becky ordered a French Martini, which she liked.\n\n\n\nBecky’s drink: French Martini - Grey Goose, Chambord & Pineapple Juice. Tony’s drink: Bottom drink: Sir Connery - Highland Park 12-year-old, Apple Schnapps, Agave Syrup, Cinnamon & Angostura Bitters.\n\n\nThen we headed to the Founders Bar for a second cocktail. We sat at the bar, which was a very interesting experience - it was fun to watch the bartenders create all sorts of unique and smokey drinks. I ordered The Lone Star, which was a bit too sweet for me. Becky had a drink called the Not So Sure, which she liked, but would not get again.\n\n\n\nLeft: “The Lone Star” - Elijah Craig Small Batch Barrel Bourbon, Sugar-Free Vanilla Syrup, Orange Bitters, White Sugar, Pear. Right: “Not So Sure” - Earl Grey-Infused Woodford Reserve Bourbon, Maple Syrup, Old Fashioned Bitters.\n\n\nDinner tonight was at the Polo Grill. I had the Filet Mignon, and Becky enjoyed the Grilled Rack of Lamb."

The curriculum focuses on regional recipes, advanced techniques, and flavor profiles often inspired directly by the destinations the ship visits, ensuring the educational experience is fully integrated with the voyage itself.\nClasses are reserved prior to the cruise and usually fill up in advance. Sometimes there are openings on the first day of the cruise and during the cruise there is usually a standby line before each class. The cost of the class is $129 per person.

I used the automatic machine to make a cup of coffee; it was decent, though not the best I’ve had from that type of brewer. The lounge was completely empty, so I had the tranquil space to myself. I worked on my trip report while enjoying the solitude and waiting for sunrise. Since no one was around I didn’t feel awkward about doing voice typing on my phone.\n\n\n\nThe coffee machine in the Horizon Lounge. This is where I usually had my first cup of coffee. The cappuccino wasn’t that good; it was a bit too bitter, but the latte was OK and that’s what I usually had. I’m using my personal mug which keeps the coffee warmer and is less prone to spilling.\n\n\nThe weather has been beautiful.\nWe had breakfast in the Grand Dining Room. I ordered Eggs Benedict, while Becky enjoyed an omelet paired with lamb chops.\nThe morning was dedicated to friendly competition. We played miniature golf for O-points, and then followed it up with a game of Bago for more O-points. We also continued working on the Art Scavenger Hunt, which seems more challenging on this cruise compared to previous ones.\nSince the gift shops were open, we stopped in to browse. The clothing selection was poor, mostly featuring high-end items like purses over $500, expensive watches, and diamonds. However, Becky found a T-shirt she liked and purchased it, making a small dent in our non-refundable onboard credit.\nFor lunch, we went to the Terrace Cafe where the daily theme was Mexican cuisine. This was followed by attending the traditional afternoon tea.\n\n\n\nMy selections for afternoon tea - two small sandwiches and a tart.\n\n\nIn the afternoon, we teamed up with Randy and his crew for trivia, and our team managed to snag the top score! Becky and I collected 20 O-points for the win.\nLater, we attended the Captain’s Cocktail Reception. We were introduced to the Captain as President’s Circle level guest by the Hotel Director when we went through the reception line. Drinks and small bites were served and the string quartet played classical selections. During the presentation the top cruisers were acknowledged. The reception was rather boring and crowded, so we agreed to skip this event on our next cruise.\nDinner was in the main dining room, where we both enjoyed the excellent lobster entree. Afterward, we participated in the evening trivia up in the Horizon’s lounge, teaming up with a retired English teacher. We only managed to get 6 out of 15 questions correct this time.\nBy the end of the day, we had found about 25 of the 60 items required for the art scavenger hunt."

    "text": "Status Match and Benefits\nOceania has one of the best loyalty programs amongst all of the cruise lines. The more you cruise with them, the better the benefits get. This is our fourth Oceania cruise; the nice benefits start after about 10 cruises.\nWe had heard rumors that Oceania’s parent company, NCL Holdings, would begin status matching across their three brands. This finally happened on September 29, 2025, with the first eligible sailings starting on October 15, 2025. The program allows members of the company’s three brands: Norwegian Cruise Line, Oceania Cruises and Regent Seven Seas Cruises, to have their loyalty status honored across the other brands.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome items waiting for us in our room on the first day. Two boxes of chocolates, three bottles of wine and a bowl of fruit. One bottle of wine was for our actual Bronze level status. Two bottles of wine and the boxes of chocolates were for status matching to the President’s Circle level.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA look inside one of the chocolate boxes. We took both boxes home.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs NCL Ambassadors, we status match to Oceania President’s Circle level. At this level, the benefits are pretty generous. For example, we get:\n\nPrestige Select beverage package\nTwo Complimentary Custom Air Fee Waivers (Total Value $398)\nGeneral Manager’s VIP List\nComplimentary Laundry Service\nShipboard Credit (Per Stateroom) of $1,250\nComplimentary Wine Tasting\nPriority Terminal Check-In\nInvitation to Special Dinner with Officers\nComplimentary bottle of Oceania Club private label wine\n10% onboard savings on Oceania Cruises logo merchandise\nTwo Complimentary Aquamar Spa Treatment Credits (each up to) $200\n10% onboard savings on Oceania Cruises logo merchandise\n\nMany of these benefits we don’t take advantage of. The shipboard credit of $1,250 combined with other promotional credits, means that we have about $2,000 of non-refundable onboard credit to spend on this cruise. Given that basic WiFi (which is unlimited, whereas NCL’s basic WiFi is only 150 minutes per cruise), the Prestige Select beverage package and gratuities are included - spending about $2,000 on the ship is a little challenging. Shore excursions and gift shop purchases is where we will be spending most of the credit.\nBecky has been taking advantage of the free, unlimited laundry. So far on this cruise, the laundry has come back within 24 hours. The shirts are all on hangars and everything else is nicely folded. On previous Oceania cruises we received three included laundry services and the laundry was returned usually within three days and not as neatly folded or on hangers.\nAt time of booking we selected the House Select Beverage Package promotion which includes a selection of wines, champagnes and beers that can be enjoyed during lunch and dinner at onboard restaurants. These are only available during lunch and dinner meal times. Generally 1130am to 2pm and 630pm to 930pm. The status match gave us the Prestige Select Beverage Package making the House Select Beverage Package redundant and meant that cocktails and other beverages were free.\nOceania’s current promotion is called, “Your World Included”. All specialty dining, gratuities and unlimited WiFi is included. Also, you get a choice between the House Select Beverage Package or $800 in shore excursion credit. Given that the status match includes the Prestige Select package, a better choice would be to take the shore excursion credit.\nThe specialty restaurants, meals in the Grand Dining Room and the Terrace Cafe (buffet) are in general a bit elevated compared to NCL and Holland. However, unless you have priority restaurant booking that comes with Penthouse cabins and above, you will most likely be dining at a sharing table in the specialty restaurants.\nPrior to the cruise, I sent an email to Oceania requesting status matching for this cruise. Oceania will status match on request and per cruise. About 12 days prior to sailing I received an email stating that we had received the status match. I reprinted our boarding passes which now reflected the new status and needed for priority boarding. When we received our key cards, the House Select Beverage Package code was printed on our cards.\n\n\n\nSince we had the Prestige Select Beverage Package, we were able to order premium water at any meal."

    "text": "Tue, Nov 18 - At Sea\nMy day started early at 5am with a shower, followed by coffee and working on my trip report in the Horizon Lounge. The weather continued to be pleasant - sunny, warm, and humid. We were still enjoying very flat seas with hardly any motion, just a minor vibration from the ship’s engines.\nWe had breakfast in the Grand Dining Room. Becky was a little put out because her meal wasn’t served course-by-course along with mine. Afterwards, we stopped by Baristas for coffee. Becky noticed there was lipstick on her cup and pointed it out to the staff member. Instead of making a new drink, he simply poured the contents into a clean cup. I thought a fresh cup should have been made.\nBefore lunch, I got a pre-lunch dessert: a crêpe with vanilla ice cream from the crêperie. I had been too full to try one the day before.\nWe also stopped by the Future Cruise desk to check the pricing for a Panama Canal cruise. It turns out booking a future cruise while onboard can save about 5%.\nWe had lunch in the Grand Cafe. I ordered a club sandwich while Becky had a shrimp dish. Later, we participated in the 1:15pm ring toss for O-points.\nAt 4pm, we played the afternoon trivia game with the same team as yesterday. We managed to win again, and we each collected three O-points. One of our teammates is a retired college instructor who seems to know roughly half the answers.\nIf I get the chance, I’ll ask him what subjects he taught. Between events, we continued our hunt for items on the arts scavenger hunt list.\nDinner was at Tuscana, the ship’s Italian specialty restaurant. We had reserved a table for two, but upon check-in, we were told we had a sharing table. We immediately declined, as sharing tables can sometimes seat only four people, making conversation difficult if no other couples are present or if the couple you get stuck with talks too much or doesn’t say anything. We were given a table for two, though not by the window, which was perfectly fine.\nThe dinner was excellent. I had the “Pollo Al Forno Al Profumo Di Limone E Crosta Di Parmigiano”. Becky enjoyed the “Aragosta Fra Diavolo Con Tagliolini”, served without the chili peppers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAragosta Fra Diavolo Con Tagliolini - Maine lobster, tagliolini, garlic, chili peppers, Italian parsley, and tomato sauce, served without the chili peppers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPollo Al Forno Al Profumo Di Limone E Crosta Di Parmigiano - roasted Parmesan-crusted lemon chicken with rustic rosemary roasted potatoes and vegetable jardinière.\n\n\n\n\n\nFor dessert, we both opted for ice cream. Becky chose mint chocolate chip, while I tried a flavor called “Elvis, the Fat Years” by Humphry Slocombe. I had never heard of the brand before cruising with Oceania. Their ice cream is simply the best - so incredibly rich and creamy. I make it a point to try the daily new flavor whenever possible. Humphry Slocombe is a well-known, high-end ice cream company based in the San Francisco Bay Area, founded in 2008 by Jake Godby and Sean Vahey, famous for unique, adult-focused flavors like Secret Breakfast, and named after characters from Are You Being Served?\nWhen we returned to our room after dinner, we found letters from the shore excursion desk informing us that two of our booked tours were canceled due to lack of participation.\nWe went to the Horizon’s Lounge for the evening trivia. We joined another couple we had met the previous evening, but we only answered about 8 out of 15 questions correctly, so we didn’t win any O-points this time.\nBefore going to bed, we reviewed the available tours to find possible replacements. Tomorrow, we’ll visit the Shore Excursion Desk to sort out new bookings.\nBy the end of the day, we had found 40 of the 60 items for the art scavenger hunt."

    "text": "Wed, Nov 19 - Oranjestad, Aruba\nMy day began early. I was up at 5am, and after a quick shower, I headed to the Horizon Lounge for my first cup of coffee. I am usually the first person there, but by 5:30am, a few others began to arrive.\nOnce again, we enjoyed breakfast in the main dining room. This morning, Becky and I both selected the omelets.\nAt 8am, the shore excursion desk opened, and we wasted no time getting there. Our priority was to sign up for replacement tours since some of our original bookings had been canceled. In addition to selecting the new tours, we also reserved a transfer from the cruise terminal to the airport on disembarkation day.\nWith those logistics settled, we went to play mini golf for O-points. I scored zero O-points, having missed every shot, and Becky managed to get one O-point.\nWe left the ship around 10:15and and walked across the street to the public bus Transportation Center. We bought two round-trip bus tickets for $5 each. From there, we took a fifteen-minute bus ride to our destination - Eagle Beach.\n\n\n\nA steel drum band playing at the cruise terminal in Aruba.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Oceania Allura in Aruba docked near the ship named the Freewinds. According to Google, the Freewinds is a ship usually moored in Oranjestad, Aruba, and is owned and operated by the Church of Scientology.\n\n\n\n\n\nEagle Beach.\n\n\nThe beach had a fair number of people, but we easily found an open spot and laid out our towels. The weather was warm, about 90 degrees, with a stiff, persistent wind. It was partially sunny with clouds occasionally blowing through. The water was a bit on the cool side, comparable to a swimming pool, but pleasant enough. We enjoyed the sun and sand for about an hour and fifteen minutes before deciding to head back.\nWe walked a short distance back to the main road and asked two policemen on bikes for directions to the nearest bus stop. On our way, we spotted two city buses heading in the direction we wanted, which was discouraging. When we finally reached the bus stop, we had a 35-minute wait before our bus arrived, instead of the advertised 15 minute wait.\nBack on board the ship, we went to the main pool for a swim. Afterward, Becky went back to the room to shower while I went to the spa. I relaxed in the thermal spa for a while, followed by about fifteen minutes in the steam room. I made good use of the spa’s shower facilities before leaving.\nAt 3pm, we attended afternoon tea. Since we had skipped lunch, we especially appreciated having two of the small finger sandwiches.\nOur evening started with pre-dinner cocktails at the Founders Bar. We have been making a point of trying the bar’s list of unique specialty drinks.\nDinner tonight was at Jacques, the French specialty restaurant. Becky ordered the “Carré D’agneau Rôti Aux Herbes, Ratatouille, Gratin Dauphinois” - herb-roasted lamb rack, ratatouille, potato gratin. I had the Dover sole, which was excellent and I would get it again on a future cruise. Dover sole is also served in Toscana, the Italian restaurant, but it’s much better here in the French restaurant and it’s served with the lemon-caper butter sauce.\n\n\n\n“Sole Grenobloise” - Dover sole, crispy bread croutons, lemon-caper butter"

    "text": "Thur, Nov 20 - Willemstad, Curaçao\nThe weather today was typically Caribbean - mostly sunny, warm and humid.\nOur breakfast was delivered to the room at 7:30am and our shore excursion meeting was scheduled for 8:30am in the theater. By the time we arrived, our tour group had already been called. We quickly headed outside to catch up with the rest of the tour.\nToday’s tour was called Sea & See Island Discovery.\nThe first part of the tour introduced us to the underwater world via the Seaworld Explorer. This semi-submarine remains above sea level, and the passengers sit comfortably in a viewing hull submerged five feet below the surface. The undersea views were better than expected. We were treated to a spectacle of colorful reef fish, like yellowtail snapper, parrotfish, and sergeant majors, attracted right up to the windows by an accompanying diver armed with their favorite food.\nAfter returning to dry land, we reboarded the coach for a scenic drive. We crossed the Queen Juliana Bridge, which arches 185 feet over St. Anna Bay, offering incredible panoramic views of the city and harbor.\nOur final destination was the Chobolobo distillery, housed in a Dutch colonial country estate. Here, we took a guided tour and sampled the famous Curaçao liqueur, which is made from the peel of bitter oranges brought to the island centuries ago. I purchased a bottle of authentic Blue Curaçao as a souvenir.\n\n\n\nThe welcome to Curaçao sign at the cruise ship terminal.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassengers walking to the semi-sub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUpstairs seating on the semi-sub.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe semi-sub was more like a glass bottom boat. We each had a nice window to see out of.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the coral.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA scuba diver feeding the fish.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMore of the corals.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe semi-submersible sub was a neat experience. It was something that Becky always wanted to do and it was much better than I expected.\n\n\n\nThe tour continued to the home of the liquor called Blue Curaçao.\n\n\n\n\n\nI purchased one of these, for $31, to take home. The blue color is from food coloring. You can get the same liquor without the coloring and it’s clear.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUnfortunately, Becky was coming down with a cold, so she headed back to the cabin to take a nap after the excursion.\nI went to grab lunch and then set out to explore the area near the port on my own. Since I wasn’t interested in shopping, I was able to see the main sights fairly quickly.\nBack on board in the afternoon, I spent some time working on the art scavenger hunt. I have 8 items to find. We also tried our luck at the afternoon trivia, but our team’s score of 14 wasn’t enough to earn us any O-points.\nDinner tonight was pizza. In the evening, Waves Grill turns into a pizzeria. We ordered one pizza to share. Half the pizza came with the toppings Becky wanted and the other half came with the ones I wanted. The pizza was good and we plan to eat there on future cruises."

    "text": "Fri, Nov 21 - Kralendijk, Bonaire\nOur port of call was Kralendijk, the capital of Bonaire, which forms the “B” of the ABC islands (Aruba, Bonaire, and Curaçao). This special municipality of the Netherlands lies about 80 km (50 miles) off the coast of Venezuela.\nAfter settling in, I started the day with coffee at the Horizon Lounge, while working on the blog. Breakfast was a satisfying omelet from the buffet before getting ready for the morning’s activities.\nUnfortunately, Becky wasn’t feeling well and decided to skip the planned excursion.\nI proceeded to the theater for the meeting point of the Eco-Powered Tuk-Tuk City Tour. This open-air ride provided a fantastic orientation to Kralendijk. Our friendly driver/guide offered lively commentary as we zipped around in the electric mini-taxi. We saw several key sights, including Fort Orange with its historic cannons, Bonaire’s largest church, and the delightful, widespread Dutch architecture. It was a brisk, open-air welcome to the city whose Dutch name, Kralendijk, means “coral dike.”\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere were three Tuk-Tuk buses on this tour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFor about 40 minutes we drove around town while listening to a narration about the island.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter the Tuk-Tuk tour ended, I embarked on my own DIY walking tour, hitting several landmarks: Fort Oranje (1639), with its cannons; Plaza Wilhelmina (Wilhelmina Park); Protestante Kerk van Kralendijk (Bonaire’s largest church); The Tourism Office; the Lions Club Monument Time Capsule.\nI also browsed the local shops on Kayla Gransi Street, stopping by the High Spirit Cuban Cigar & Liquor store and the local Salt Shop.\nBack onboard, lunch was a relaxing affair at the Terrace Cafe. For an afternoon treat, we headed up to the Crêperie: I ordered in a Crêpes Suzette, which I didn’t care for, while Becky enjoyed an ice cream in a waffle cone. We finished with coffee at Baristas, a cappuccino for me and a latte for Becky. Later we received a few tips on locating some missing art pieces we were hunting for.\nAt 1:30pm, we attended a complimentary wine tasting for President’s Circle members, normally priced at $75 plus gratuity. The theme was “Pinot, the heartbreak grape,” which was perfect, as Pinot Noir is my favorite red wine.\nThe tasting explored this delicate, thin-skinned variety known for producing elegant and complex wines. The grape is called “the heartbreak grape” and yields light to medium-bodied wines with classic bright red fruit (cherry, raspberry) and earthy notes. We sampled five different Pinot Noirs, each paired with a small bite. The wines came from Italy ($65), France ($165), Oregon ($155), New Zealand ($110) and California ($140). The prices in parentheses are the prices per bottle if you purchase a bottle on the ship.\nThe moniker “Heartbreak Grape” stems from Pinot Noir’s extraordinary difficulty to cultivate and vinify. This thin-skinned variety is highly susceptible to rot, disease, and weather extremes, demanding a very specific, cool-climate environment to thrive.\nThe most famous and highly regarded Pinot Noir growing regions are in Burgundy, France, where the grape reaches its pinnacle of elegance and complexity, particularly in the Côte d’Or region. Other world-class, cool-climate regions where Pinot Noir thrives include the Willamette Valley in Oregon, which shares a similar latitude and climate to Burgundy and excels at producing Old World-style wines. In California, the Sonoma Coast and Russian River Valley are key areas that produce richer, fruit-forward expressions. Pinot Noir is also successfully grown in the Central Otago region of New Zealand. These regions all offer the crucial combination of warm days for ripening and cold nights to retain the grape’s delicate acidity, which is essential for balance and aging potential.\nWe also tasted a Pinot Grigio from Italy, which was surprisingly light amber in color. While I enjoyed the Pinots, which ranged in price on the ship from $65 to $165 per bottle, I honestly felt they didn’t taste significantly better than the $6 to $10 priced bottles I usually buy back home.\n\n\n\nThe setup of five wines with food for pairing with the wine. The only food I didn’t try was the steak tartare. After the presentation, additional wine was poured, usually about 1/4 of a glass of whatever you wanted.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sommelier provided an informative presentation about each of the wines. This was the best wine tasting that I’ve attended in awhile.\n\n\nIn the evening, we played trivia but didn’t manage to score any O-points.\nDinner was a lovely experience at Polo Grill. I opted for the classic Filet Mignon, while Becky enjoyed a surf-and-turf combination of lobster tail and filet mignon."

    "text": "Sat, Nov 22 - St. George’s, Grenada\nOur cruise brought us to Grenada, the “Island of Spice”, for our first visit. The weather was partly cloudy with a temperature of 90°F. Grenada is a vibrant gem known for its lush, mountainous interior and its capital, St. George’s, a picturesque harbor town.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of St. George’s from the ship.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. George’s looking the other way from the ship.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe began the day with breakfast in the grand dining room. I had “Huevos”, while Becky enjoyed an omelet and lamb chops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHuevos - avocado, poached eggs, sundried tomato, pomegranate pumpkin seeds, and rustic farmers bread. This usually comes with one poached egg, but I asked for two.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOmelet and lamb chops.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe morning’s main event was Bathrobe Trivia. Our team was motivated by the bonus: anyone wearing a bathrobe received two extra O-points. With most of us wearing our robes, we went on to achieve a remarkable perfect score of 15 out of 15, leaving the next highest team far behind with only 10 O-points. We definitely caught some suspicious looks, but we were just that good! Between activities, we continued our search for scavenger hunt art around the ship.\nAfter a quick lunch of a club sandwich for me and pasta for Becky in the grand dining room, we prepared for our afternoon excursion, “The Spice of Our Lives.” We checked in at the theater around 1pm and had a short 15-minute wait before our group of about 15 was called. As we drove, the island immediately showed its character: very hilly with narrow, winding roads.\nThe half-day tour focused on Grenada’s famed spice and rum production, featuring three distinct stops:\n\nDe La Grenade Industries: This family-owned company specializes in value-added nutmeg products. We learned how they utilize the nutmeg fruit to create items like Nutmeg Jam, Morne Délice Syrup, hot sauces and their signature La Grenade Liqueur. We toured the adjacent Nutmeg Garden and sampled their unique specialties.\nLaura Herb & Spice Garden: This was my favorite stop. The garden, located in Epping Forest, provides a highly interactive and sensory experience. Visitors walk trails paved with nutmeg shells, where guides encourage you to touch, smell and taste fresh spices like cinnamon, cloves, bay leaves, turmeric, ginger, allspice, nutmeg and cocoa straight from the plant.\nClarke’s Court Distillery: Our final stop showcased the production of Grenada’s most famous rum. We toured the historic factory, observing the vintage machinery used to process sugar cane molasses. The tour concluded with a popular tasting session, allowing us to sample their diverse, award-winning rums, from strong white rums to aged and spiced varieties.\n\n\n\n\nA view of St. George’s from the tour bus.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the many nutmeg products.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSauces made from nutmeg.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur tour guide at the Laura Herb & Spice Garden.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe red spiky pods are most likely the seed pods of the Annatto plant. Annatto seeds are not typically eaten as a fruit, but the seeds inside the pods are harvested to produce a yellow-to-orange dye and food coloring (sometimes used as a substitute for saffron) and an aromatic spice, commonly used in Latin American and Caribbean cuisine. The small green berries is an unripe strand of Green Peppercorns.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis yellow pod with white pulp is a Cacao Pod showing the fruit cut open to expose the beans and pulp. The Pod - The large, yellow, ribbed fruit is the pod of the cacao tree. The Pulp - The white, slimy, sweet pulp covering the beans is edible and often used to make juice or fermented to aid in the chocolate-making process. The Beans - Inside the pulp are the cacao beans (which look like large, purplish seeds), the source of chocolate.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had to wear yellow safety hats during the tour.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSome of the old steam powered equipment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe rum distillation column was the only part of the sugar mill still in operation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe selection of rum available for tasting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSun set in Grenada.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe tour concluded around 5:30pm. While I thoroughly enjoyed the tour, especially the hands-on experience at the spice garden, Becky rated the overall excursion as just average. After being dropped off, we walked around the town of St. George’s briefly, but found that most shops were already closing up around 5pm. We should have applied mosquito repellent to our arms and legs before the tour. We each got about 15 bug bits which started to itch the following day.\nFor dinner, we opted for a relaxing evening and chose to dine in our room with selections from Jacques. Our entrées were delivered around 6:45pm. For our main courses, I chose “Homard Thermidor”and Becky enjoyed “Gambas À L’armoricaine”.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFirst course: “Salade De Crabe Au Raifort Et Sauce À L’orange Sanguine” - lump crab meat salad, horseradish, blood orange sauce and “Crème De Potiron” - creamy pumpkin soup.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n“Gambas À L’armoricaine” - shrimp in tomato-cognac cream sauce and “Homard Thermidor” - lobster baked in shell with a mushroom cream sauce.\n\n\n\n\n\nDinner was good and it was nice not to have to get changed for dinner after our tour."

I settled in with a cup of coffee and finished working on my blog about yesterday’s activities. Both Becky and I are still getting over colds, so we started the day with some over-the-counter daytime cold and flu medicine.\nToday, our ship is docked in Castries, St. Lucia. This vibrant capital and largest city is Saint Lucia’s primary political, commercial, and economic center. It’s situated on the northwest coast, built around a deep, naturally protected harbor that is a major port for cruise ships.\nAfter Becky was ready, we went up to Baristas for her morning coffee. I enjoyed a Cappuccino with a Pain au Chocolat. Looking out at the harbor, we noted the two other ships in port with us: the Holland Komsingdam and the P&O Britannia.\n\n\n\nCappuccino with a Pain au Chocolat.\n\n\nWe then had breakfast in the Grand Dining Room. We both ordered omelets, and Becky also enjoyed lamb chops.\nThe rest of the morning was spent relaxing at the Aquamare Spa. I spent time reading my Kindle in the shade. I also spent 15 minutes relaxing in the Steam room.\nWe had a quick lunch back in the Grand Dining Room. At 4pm we attended trivia. We got 2nd place.\nLater in the afternoon, we attended the exclusive Oceania Club Members party, where drinks and small bites were served. The top Oceania cruisers were introduced. One of the top cruisers were Randy and Denise, our trivia partners, with over 1500 cruise nights.\nFor dinner, we dined at Toscana. I had the sea bass, while Becky went for the “Aragosta Fra Diavolo Con Tagliolini”, a dish featuring Maine lobster, tagliolini, garlic, chili peppers, Italian parsley, and tomato sauce. This is the second time on this cruise that she has ordered this dish.\nThe evening continued with a round of trivia at 8:15pm. Then, at 9:30pm, we went to the show, which was called “Broadway.” It was described as a documentary and concert, offering a backstage look at the history of Broadway. This multimedia performance celebrated the elements that bring a show to life - music, dance, costumes, choreography and the creative process.\nWe ended up leaving the show early. Becky thought the multimedia elements were interesting, but we both wished they had performed more popular Broadway hits. We left around the same time as an elderly couple in our row who also decided to depart."

    "text": "Mon, Nov 24 - Gustavia, St. Barts\nToday, we visited the island of Saint Barthélemy (St. Barts), arriving bright and early as the ship reached its anchor station by 7am. St. Barts is a tender port. This morning we enjoyed breakfast in the Grand Dining Rroom.\nAfter gathering our belongings, we headed to the theater around 9am to pick up our tender tickets. Our group was called shortly after, at around 9:15am, and the tender ride across the harbor to Gustavia took about 20 minutes. The sight upon arrival was stunning: about ten superyachts were moored in the harbor, emphasizing why the island is known as the “Billionaires’ Playground.” St. Barts, a French overseas collectivity, is truly a jewel renowned for its chic, high-end atmosphere, pristine beaches and picturesque hillsides.\nOnce ashore, we began a self-guided walking tour of the capital, Gustavia, which blends French elegance with tropical relaxation. We visited several historic and scenic spots. First up was the Anglican Episcopal Church (St. Bartholomew’s Anglican Church), built in 1855, is a key example of beautiful local colonial style, offering a cool, serene respite from the Caribbean sun within its shaded interior.\nNearby, the simple but distinctive Swedish Clock Tower stands as a key reminder of St. Barts’ nearly century-long rule by Sweden (1784–1878), providing a visual link to this unique period in the island’s history.\nConstructed around 1800, the Swedish Clock Tower was originally the bell tower of a Lutheran church that was later destroyed by a cyclone, leaving the intact tower as the sole remaining structure. This monument, built from volcanic stone and topped with distinctive light-green wooden cladding, features a bell named “Sofia Magdalena,” which was cast in Stockholm in 1799. Today, the Swedish Clock Tower serves as a popular visitor site, representing a preserved piece of the island’s architectural heritage and its enduring historical connection to Sweden.\nThese historic structures are complemented by the Church of Our Lady of the Assumption, the island’s primary Roman Catholic church.\nFrom there we continued our walk to Shell Beach (Anse des Coquillages) which offers a unique coastal experience, distinct from the island’s famous powdered-sand shores, as the beach is composed almost entirely of millions of tiny, smooth white shells.\nOur last stop was Fort Karl (Fort Gustav), one of the historic military defenses of the harbor. Although now mostly ruins, the hill where the fort is located is a must-visit for the spectacular panoramic views it provides, allowing visitors to look down upon the iconic Gustavia harbor, the yachts, the red-roofed town and the vast Caribbean Sea.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSt. Bartholomew’s Anglican Church.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alter of St. Bartholomew’s Anglican Church.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChurch of Our Lady of the Assumption.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe alter of Our Lady of the Assumption church.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwedish Clock Tower.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShell Beach\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe shells on Shell Beach.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of Shell Beach from Fort Karl.\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of harbor from Fort Karl.\n\n\n\n\n\nOne of the shopping areas on St. Barts, Rue du General de Gaulle\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Lounge Barons de Rothschild, where the wine tasting excursion was held.\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of the harbor from Gustavia Lighthouse.\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of the Allura from Gustavia Lighthouse.\n\n\nWe finished our walk around 11am and headed back to the tender dock. Becky went back to the ship alone, as I planned to stay on the island a little longer before my scheduled excursion.\nUsing the extra time, I walked up to the Gustavia Lighthouse, which offered spectacular panoramic views of the island, the bustling harbor, and the neighboring islands of Nevis and St. Kitts. I then walked back to the shaded, breezy garden of the Anglican Church to wait for my 1:25pm tour meeting time. I’m also feeling relieved that my cold is much better today.\nThe excursion started with a ten minute walk from the tender area to the Lounge Barons de Rothschild, a sophisticated wine boutique and gourmet lounge in Gustavia. This chic establishment is a haven for connoisseurs, offering fine wines and Champagnes directly sourced from the illustrious Rothschild family châteaux. We enjoyed a delightful tasting of two Champagnes and two red wines, all of which were excellent, accompanied by a plate of superb French cheeses and a basket of bread.\nThere were six of us on this excursion. Two couples, a solo lady and me. The people on the tour were pleasant, the conversation was nice, and it made for an enjoyable and refined experience.\n\n\n\nThe wine presenter. He did a good job presenting the wines and describing the history of the Barons de Rothschild wines. He was a bit hard to understand with his French accent, so I needed to pay extra close attention.\n\n\nBelow are the two champagnes and two red wines we tasted. The first champagne was made from chardonnay grapes and was very, very nice. It was semi-dry and had a wonderful taste. It reminded me of Veuve Clicquot Yellow Label, but perhaps a bit better. Everyone in our group agreed that this champagne was excellent.\nThe next champagne was a rose, which I didn’t like as much. It tasted rather ordinary. The next two samples were red wines and these were good and paired well with the bread and cheese. The cheese was outstanding and perhaps the highlight of the tasting. I’m not a fan of brie, but apparently, I’ve never tasted good brie. This brie was smooth and creamy, like soft butter, and it kind of reminded me of the taste of butter. It was wonderful.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe cheese platter, perhaps the best and most delightful aspect of the tasting.\n\n\nAfter the wine tasting, I headed back to the harbor and took the tender back to the ship. I met up with Becky, who was queued up for the afternoon beanbag toss competition. Later, at the 4:30pm trivia, we joined our team and happily won first place.\nLater we enjoyed pre-dinner drinks in the Martini Lounge before having dinner in the Grand Dining Room with two of our trivia partners, John and Carrie. The fun continued after dinner with the evening trivia in the Horizon Lounge, where we secured third place with a different team. By 8:30pm, we decided to skip the comedy show and called it a night."

    "text": "Tue, Nov 25 - Tortola, British Virgin Islands\nToday marks our last port of call in Tortola, British Virgin Islands, where we are docked alongside the ultra-luxury Crystal cruise ship. With no excursions planned, we decided on a tranquil day entirely spent onboard.\nThe weather is mostly cloudy with occasional rain showers, and the high temperature is 84F.\nWe started the day with breakfast in the Grand Dining Room. Becky enjoyed an omelet accompanied by lamb chops, while I also opted for an omelet.\nFollowing breakfast, we spent a couple of hours at the exclusive Spa Terrace. Access to this deck is restricted to guests in concierge cabins and above, making it a delightfully uncrowded and peaceful area.\nI spent most of my time reading my Kindle in the shade, occasionally taking a dip in the Thalassotherapy Pool. This therapeutic pool is filled with warmed seawater and features underwater jets for hydromassage.\nA quick note on the Spa Terrace: Unlike the loungers on other Oceania ships, the shaded area here only has six heated beds, which aren’t quite as comfortable. Nevertheless, I managed to squeeze in a short nap.\n\n\n\nThalassotherapy Pool\n\n\n\n\n\nHeated lounge chairs.\n\n\nLater, I decided to experience the saunas. Before entering, I tried the unique “Experience Shower”, a multisensory feature that combines colored lighting with varying water temperatures and effects (cool overhead, warm massaging jets from the sides). While I found it a bit of a gimmick, I’m glad I gave it a try. I then spent about 10 minutes in the dry sauna before moving on to the stream sauna, which I enjoyed more.\nAfter a casual lunch at the Terrace Cafe, we returned to our cabin to finish a movie we had started a few days prior.\n\n\n\nLeft to right: soft ice cream in a cone, two frozen coffees, salted caramel ice cream in a cup with some toppings.\n\n\nAt 3pm, I headed back to the spa for my haircut appointment. The cost was covered by our spa credits, with only the mandatory 20% service charge (aka the tip) being paid out of our onboard credit.\nOur afternoon trivia session at 4:30pm was a success, we took home second place.\nWe kicked off the evening with pre-dinner drinks at the Founders Bar.\nDinner tonight was at Red Ginger, the specialty Asian fusion restaurant.\nOur appetizers were spring rolls and prawns.\nFor our first course, we ordered the “To Share” platter, featuring skewers (chicken, beef, shrimp), the chef’s selection of sushi, and tempura (rock prawn, calamari).\nBecky chose the Seven Spice-Crusted Lamb Rack (served with wasabi-lamb jus, shiitake mushrooms, and snow peas) for her main course. I had Thai Red Curry Chicken (with eggplant, baby corn, lime leaves, and basil).\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVietnamese Pork Spring Roll - sweet & sour fish sauce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaramelized Prawns - onions, chili-garlic sauce, scallions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSkewers, Sushi & Tempura - skewers: chicken, beef, shrimp, sushi: chef’s selection, tempura: rock prawn, calamari\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThai Red Curry Chicken - eggplant, baby corn, lime leaves, basil\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeven Spice-Crusted Lamb Rack - wasabi-lamb jus, shiitake mushrooms, snow peas\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSteamed Jasmine Rice, Green Asparagus, White Miso Glaze\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBounty Cake - coconut, chocolate chips, vanilla bean\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMatcha Green Tea - Ice Cream\n\n\n\n\n\nOverall, dinner at Red Ginger was good. The food was very tasty. On a previous cruise we were not impressed with Red Ginger. This time, I ordered something different and Becky repeated the lamb chops. Although I would rank Red Ginger at the bottom of all the restaurants on Allura, the food tonight was very good. The only negative aspects were - it was very noisy and the room temperature was on the warm side.\nTo cap off the night, we participated in evening trivia and won first place, scoring those coveted O-points."

    "text": "Wed, Nov 26 - At Sea\nToday marks the first of two sea days on our return voyage to Miami. The weather is beautiful, with mostly sunny skies and highs in the upper 80s. The sailing conditions have been exceptionally calm throughout this trip; we hardly feel like we’re at sea, even out in the Atlantic.\nOur day began with breakfast in the Grand Dining Room. Becky enjoyed a western omelet with sausage, while I ordered avocado toast with poached eggs. Unfortunately, I had to send my eggs back as they weren’t cooked as ordered, a minor but rare stumble, as this was the first food issue I’ve had all trip.\nThe morning was spent participating in scheduled events to earn O-points. These events typically start about an hour after breakfast and are spaced roughly an hour apart. While waiting in line, we’ve had the pleasure of meeting some genuinely nice people whom we continue to run into throughout the day. In fact, we ended up having afternoon tea with one of the couples we met this morning.\nFor lunch, we returned to the Grand Dining Room. Becky had the braised cod, which she declared excellent, though the accompanying salmon roe (which we both tasted) was notably salty. I ordered a Croque Monsieur, the classic French baked sandwich of ham and cheese topped with Mornay sauce; and it was truly delicious. After lunch, we dedicated some time to a few more events to earn additional O-points.\n\n\n\nThe Croque Monsieur.\n\n\nAfter lunch we decided to get dessert at the Crêperie, which is located conveniently adjacent to Baristas, the coffee bar, and just around the corner from The Bakery.\n\n\n\nBubble waffle cone with soft ice cream. We ordered our ice cream on the side. But you could get the waffle cone filled with whatever you wanted. The waffle cone itself was soft and we just tore pieces off to eat with the ice cream. Becky ordered salted caramel with chocolate sauce and I ordered bourbon vanilla ice cream, which didn’t taste like Kentucky bourbon at all - it was just regular vanilla ice cream.\n\n\nAt 3pm, we attended the formal afternoon tea, sharing a table with the couple we had met earlier. Later, around 4:30pm, we participated in afternoon trivia. Our team performed well enough to secure third place, and both Becky and I finally contributed correct answers! Becky knew that Dark and Stormy was the drink made from a list of ingredients which was the clue; and I knew that SSD stands for Solid State Drive. We were both thrilled to pitch in.\n\n\n\nPre-dinner drinks at Martini’s Bar.\n\n\nDinner was once again with John and Carrie. Becky had the lobster, and I enjoyed the Beef Wellington. The food tonight was exceptional. The evening concluded with a music trivia event. Our team included some members from the afternoon session, plus four new players, bringing us to a total of eight. Together, we managed to achieve a perfect score!\nWe headed to the main theater at 9pm to secure our favorite seats for the 9:30pm show; back row, on an aisle, in case we wanted an easy exit. As it turned out, we left about fifteen minutes into the performance since the music wasn’t to our taste."

Becky enjoyed her usual omelet and lamb chops, while I opted for avocado toast with poached eggs.\nAfter we ate, we played a quick round of indoor golf, scoring additional O-points.\nWe reviewed our statement and were surprised to find an extra $200 in non-refundable onboard credit. I went to the front desk for a printout and an explanation, discovering that we had received a 25% discount based on the number of shore excursions we booked. With this bonus, we visited the gift shop and stocked up on extras like lip balm, a men’s swimsuit and sunscreen.\nBecky had started her packing yesterday, and I tackled my packing this morning. We paused our efforts for the 2pm Trivia competition, where our team secured first place. This was immediately followed by the Art Scavenger Hunt answer review. Because we got all 60 answers correct, we earned 20 O-points.\nThe O-point redemption was next. I chose a long-sleeve cotton shirt for 70 O-points, and Becky got a shirt, hat, and some socks. We still have O-points left over, which we’ll save for our next Ocean cruise. After that, it was back to the room to continue packing.\nFor dinner, we ate in the main dining room, and both of us selected the traditional turkey dinner entrée. We returned to the room one last time to finish our packing for the evening."

    "text": "Fri, Nov 28 - Disembarkation, Miami\nWe started the day an hour earlier than usual. After a quick shower and final packing, I grabbed a coffee at the Horizons Lounge. By 5:30am, the ship was slowly moving into the port of Miami and making its way to the cruise terminal.\nThe weather in Miami was overcast and about 70F, which felt noticeably cooler than what we had been used to over the last week and a half.\nBefore breakfast, I used the bathroom scale to weigh our suitcases. Becky’s was 48 pounds and mine was 52.8 pounds. We quickly juggled some items to equalize the weight. Ironically, we later learned at the airport that our weight limit for this flight was 70 pounds per bag, not the usual 50 pounds for domestic flights.\nWe went to the Grand Dining Room for breakfast at 6:50am. There was already a line, but we were seated quickly, and breakfast only took about 30 minutes. Back in the cabin, we did our final room check and packing, leaving the cabin promptly at 8am, the required time to vacate the room for all passengers.\nWe headed to the ship’s atrium to wait for our designated group to be called. While waiting, we chatted with two of our trivia partners, who were heading to Detroit. The atrium was packed with people ready to disembark and the hallways were crowded.\nBecky pointed out that next time, we should wait in the atrium on Deck 5. The gangway was on Deck 6, so Deck 5 had many more empty seats.\nEventually, Becky got tired of waiting, and since the line had cleared, we simply got up and walked off. Once inside the terminal, there was a line of about 100 people. By 9:30am, we were in line waiting for immigration, which moved quickly. We were out of the terminal and looking for our driver by 9:45am. We had reserved a private car using some of our non-refundable onboard credit, and despite some traffic, we arrived at the airport in about 20 minutes.\nCheck-in at the American Airlines counter was quick. The walk to TSA PreCheck was long, but we passed through security quickly. For some reason, TSA PreCheck and CLEAR are only available at a few checkpoints at the Miami airport.\nWe then walked to the American Airlines Flagship Lounge, arriving at 10:45am. We had a brief issue checking in because the scanner couldn’t read our tickets, but we were eventually granted access after new tickets were printed.\nAbout a month ago, American Airlines changed our return flight’s plane from a 737 to a 777. This meant our First Class tickets were automatically upgraded to Flagship Class, giving us access to the lounge’s food, beverages, and quiet sanctuary. We were happy for the upgrade, even though it meant departing 30 minutes later.\n\n\n\nA view of American Airline’s gates from the Flagship lounge.\n\n\nAround 11am, the lounge switched from serving breakfast to lunch; we enjoyed the chicken and vegetables. While sitting in the quiet section, one guest started a very loud phone conversation. Another person complained to a staff member, who moved the complaining guest to a different area. I used Google Translate on my phone to listen and translate the loud conversation, which sounded like Russian. It was nothing exciting, just comments about being in the lounge and traveling alone.\nWe left the Flagship lounge about 15 minutes before boarding time, not realizing how long the walk was, which also required a tram ride. We arrived at our gate just in time for boarding and ran into Randy and Denise, our trivia partners, who were on the same flight. We had seen them from a distance earlier at the cruise terminal with an escort to the front of the line. Randy explained that the escort cost them $89 because they had to pay duty on some gift shop purchases.\nThe flight home was mostly smooth, though the cabin was quite warm. I tried to get some sleep but couldn’t. Knowing that I had an hour-long drive ahead of me after landing, I couldn’t force myself to fall asleep. I should have listened to one of my audio books, because they usually put me to sleep.\nOur plane arrived at the Tom Bradley Terminal at LAX. We had a long walk to the American Airlines terminal (Terminal 4) to retrieve our baggage. After getting our bags, we went outside to wait for the FlyAway bus. The first bus passed without stopping, but about 30 minutes later, an overflow bus picked us up. We finally arrived home at 12:30am."

    "text": "Fri, Nov 14 - Travel day\nOur flight from LAX to MIA was scheduled for a 6am departure, which required a very early start. Because recent news reports have highlighted issues with long lines, delays, and cancellations at airports nationwide, we decided to leave home much earlier than usual to ensure we had extra time, especially for any unexpected queues at the TSA security checkpoints.\nWe left home at 1:12am. Despite a light rain overnight leaving the roads wet, traffic on Highway 101 toward the Flyaway bus terminal in Van Nuys was light and flowing fast.\nWe arrived at the Van Nuys Flyaway at 2:04am. I had a 2am parking reservation and, after dropping Becky off at the curb, I parked the car on the second floor, not far from the elevator. There were a few open spaces scattered around.\nAt the bus terminal, we found about 25 people waiting, many of whom appeared to be airport workers. I had incorrectly assumed the next bus was at 2:30am; after checking the schedule, I learned the next scheduled departure was actually at 3am. However, we were able to board early at 2:50am.\nThe bus arrived at LAX Terminal 1 around 3:30am and we reached Terminal 4 at 3:45am.\nThe American Airlines bag check counter didn’t open until 3:50am. After checking our two bags, we proceeded directly to the TSA security checkpoint. Fortunately, the TSA PreCheck line was completely clear.\nWe arrived at our gate at 4:07am, giving us a little over an hour to wait before boarding.\nIt was still dark outside as we boarded the plane. Since we are seated in row 2, we were in the second boarding group, right after families with young children and those needing extra time or assistance. As I post this, we are on the plane, still at the gate, waiting for the remaining passengers to board and for the doors to close.\nThe flight to Miami is scheduled to take 4 hours and 47 minutes, with an estimated arrival time of 2:00 PM local time. The weather in Miami is expected to be 79°F and partly cloudy.\nFor the flight, Becky plans to watch a movie. The in-flight entertainment is streamed to personal devices, and since I don’t enjoy watching movies on my small phone screen, I decided to pass. Instead, I’ll be reading on my Kindle or listening to audiobooks. I checked out a couple of audiobooks from the library before leaving, and the 21-day loan period means I’ll have the whole trip to finish one. I’ll listen to a few minutes of the first chapter of each until I find one I like best.\nThe cabin door closed at 5:58am and by 6:20am we were rolling down the runway for takeoff. We hit a patch of turbulence shortly after reaching cruising altitude, but thankfully, the remainder of the flight was very smooth. I was pretty tired and ended up falling asleep while reading my book.\nFor breakfast, we both chose the three-cheese omelet with potato wedges. Unfortunately, the meal was marginal - it reminded me of a cheap frozen breakfast from the grocery store. The silver lining was the coffee, which I enjoyed with Baileys.\n\n\n\nBreakfast on the plane. The fruit and yogurt were good. I ate the omelet, but not the potato wedges since they were mushy.\n\n\n\n\n\nLooking out the window at Texas below, somewhere north of Huston.\n\n\nAfter collecting our bags, we went outside to wait for the hotel shuttle. We must have just missed it, and because the shuttle only runs once an hour, we ended up waiting almost an hour. Next time, I think I’ll just call an Uber. We finally arrived at the hotel and were waiting in the check-in line by around 3:50pm.\nAfter unpacking, we took a ten-minute walk to a nearby Target to pick up some snacks. On the way back, we stopped at a small Mexican restaurant called Taqueria Los Potrillos Miami. We ordered some food to take back to the room; I had the carnitas burrito, and Becky had the chicken burrito. They were both really good.\nIt was a long day, so we turned in early."
