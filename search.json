    "text": "Becky and I are spending a week in Nuevo Vallarta. Nuevo Vallarta is located 20 minutes north of Puerto Vallarta’s International Airport.\nWe had a noon flight to Puerto Vallarta so we didn’t have to get up too early. Traffic on the way to Van Nuys was light and we got to the Flyaways bus terminal in about 50 minutes. I dropped Becky off with her bags at the terminal and then pulled the car around to look for a parking spot in the garage. There was a sign at the gate that said “parking available on the 5th floor”, which I thought was kind of strange because I’d never seen a sign like that before. The parking garage was very full and after looking around on the ground level as well as on floor two through four, I finally made my way up to the fifth floor, which is essentially the roof of the building. So the old Honda is going to spend the week out in the sun, kind of like what I have planned for myself.\nWe were able to catch the 9 a.m. bus to the airport. The bus was pretty empty with maybe only 10 people on it. Traffic from Van Nuys to the airport was light and we made it to the airport in about 25 minutes. At the airport it was extremely crowded with lots of cars and it took forever for the bus to make stops at the terminals to drop people off. It took about another 30 minutes for us to make it to the Alaska terminal which is terminal six.\nThere were about 10 people online at the bag-check counter and the line was going really really slow. I was getting worried that we were going to run out of time because bags needed to be checked one hour before departure and we only had like an hour and a half. The line did end up moving little by little and by the time we got to the counter it was probably 20 minutes later.\nWe stopped by a shop in the terminal called Gameway to pick up two sodas and two small snacks. The snacks we got were a small bag of peanut M&Ms. We can get these for “free” since this is a benefit provided by Chase Sapphire Reserve. We will have these later in the week.\nWe had an hour until boarding time since the flight was delayed by 15 minutes. When we boarded the airplane we were offered a choice of water or champagne. We both got champagne; about three sips from a paper cup, but still kind of nice. After takeoff we ordered our drinks. Becky had a margarita and I had an Old Fashioned and the drinks were served with a cup of warmed up assorted nuts.\nAbout a week before our flight we pre-ordered our meals. Becky’s choice was chicken, potatoes and white beans and the dessert was a chocolate chip cookie. Becky’s dinner drink was Sprite and Jack Daniels. After dinner Becky had the chocolate chip cookie with coffee and Bailey’s. I ordered a hamburger which was OK, not the best, and came with a small bag of potato chips and a chocolate chip cookie. I had a glass of red wine with my meal.\nOn the plane Becky watched a movie called “Anyone but you”. I watched Dune part 2. That movie is two and a half hours long and I was only able to get through 2 hours of it before we landed, so I will have to try to watch the last half hour of the movie on the return trip.\nWhen we landed in Puerto Vallarta it was raining and our bags got a little wet. We got our bags searched at customs. Apparently they saw something on the X-ray that looked a little suspicious. So we got pulled aside and they wanted to know if we had any rice or beans. The inspector wanted to know why we had so much food with us and we told him we were staying in a condo. He wanted to know if we lived in Puerto Vallarta, and we told him we were only visiting. Then he said what are you doing with all that food? I said we’re staying in a condo with a kitchen. I bet he thought, what a couple of dumb gringos; don’t they know there are supermarkets in Mexico?\nSo after poking around in our suitcase for a little bit he let us go because we didn’t have any fresh meat, vegetables, medical products or anything prohibited.\nAt the LA airport, we saw somebody carry on to the plane a fresh bouquet of flowers. They carried them all the way to Puerto Vallarta. At customs where they inspect your bags we didn’t see the flowers anymore so I guess they had to throw them away.\nAt the airport at Puerto Vallarta there is a VIP arrivals lounge so we stopped in there to get some food and some drinks (a benefit of the Chase credit card). We planned to eat a bit of food since we weren’t going to cook anything that night for dinner. We shared a ham sandwich and a veggie burrito. Both were good and we had some vegetable sticks with ranch dressing. Becky had a margarita and I had a beer.\nSince it was raining outside we decided to take a taxi to the resort instead of Uber. Uber is not allowed into the airport, so to call an Uber requires a short walk to get to the main road. We didn’t want to walk in the rain and get our luggage wet.\nAt the resort we had a short wait to check in. As we were checking in, Becky and I both started to feel really sick. At first, I felt kind of faint and started sweating. I had to ask for a glass of water and then as we were finishing up Becky started feeling really sick so she went outside to sit down.\nAfter a few minutes I started feeling better and then Becky felt better and we collected our bags and walked to our room. A few minutes after arriving in the room the porter showed up with our three big bags. He asked if we had any questions about the room and told us where the air conditioning controls were. By then we were both feeling better and we did some unpacking and went to bed early. We think it was something we ate at the VIP arrivals lounge that made us sick. But it was strange that it came and went so quickly. Maybe the ranch dressing was bad, who knows?"

    "text": "Sunday, August 25, 2024\nI got up early and made a cup of coffee and had a granola bar. I worked on my computer for a little bit. The resort has internet access through an open WiFi network. Since an open WiFi has lots of security risks associated with it, I activated a VPN service that I subscribe to for these occasions.\nLater in the morning, around 9am, we got ready to go down to the beach. First we stopped by the concierge because we had received a note at our door and it was in Spanish and I couldn’t really understand what it was saying. I thought it had something to do with housekeeping so we brought it to the concierge to have her translate it for us. It turns out it was an invitation for our welcome drink which we probably should have gotten last night but no one said anything to us.\nWe met with Gladys and she explained the activities for the week and asked if we had any questions. She asked when the last time we were here, but I think she already knew we were here last October. That meant we were not eligible for the full timeshare presentation which I was personally happy not to be eligible to attend a three hour presentation. She told us that there is a welcome party tonight at 6pm in the theater, but all of the other shows for this week were canceled (because it’s the rainy season) and they would just have themed night meals in the buffet. We will probably skip the themed dinners and just have a late lunch in the buffet on the days we eat out.\nOvernight they slipped a notice under our door which said that the main pool was going to be closed which kind of surprised us since we didn’t expect it to be closed until September, after we had departed. As a result the adult pool is open to everybody and it is pretty crowded in the afternoon.\nToday the ocean conditions are a yellow flag. On previous visits the flags have been red or black. Yellow is caution whereas red or black is dangerous or high risk.\nToday we’re at palapala #206 which is one row from the sidewalk and we just have a few short steps to the pool and going in the other direction we’re about six rows back from the beach. The temperature in the morning is 85F and the skies are clear.\n\n\n\npalapala #206\n\n\nThe resort seems a lot less crowded this morning with only a few people on the beach. But as I mentioned earlier the pool is crowded and all the chairs in the shade are taken.\nThis morning there doesn’t seem to be any Beach Attendants around and everyone has to drag their own loungers and chairs to wherever they want to sit. They can even hang out in the reserve section, whereas last year we got kicked out of the reserved section.\nAt 11:30 we went inside to order our welcome drinks because we plan to bring those drinks to lunch with us. Becky ordered a margarita and I had a beer. Becky said her margarita was not that good. We had lunch at the beachside restaurant. Becky ordered fish tacos and I ordered pork tacos, three tacos each, which we shared. Becky liked the pork tacos better than fish tacos. Though both types were good. The total price was $368 MX pesos ($19 USD) including discounts, tax and tip.\n\n\n\nbeer at beach resturant\n\n\nAt noon the temperature had risen to 90°F, still pleasant in the shade since there was a steady but warm breeze off the ocean. By then the sand was too hot to walk on without shoes or flip-flops. There’s a lot more people at the beach.\nAt 1:30 we called it quits for our beach time and headed back to the room for showers and to get ready for grocery shopping.\n\n\n\nThere are some of the birds at the resort. Their cages are along the way to the market.\n\n\nThere’s a small market located about 10 minutes walk from the resort. We picked up supplies for making breakfast (eggs), sandwiches for lunch (bread, lunch meat and sliced cheese), bottled water, Mexican beer, corn chips etc. Groceries cost $635 MX pesos ($33 USD).\nAt 6 pm we went to the welcome show which consisted of a cultural dance put on by about six performers. Drinks and a small plate of food was served. We didn’t eat any of the food because we saw the plates of food sitting out in the warm weather for at least an hour before the show started. From our balcony on the 8th floor we could see the setup and preparation area. We did drink Margaritas and a rum punch. Also they passed out popcorn in the little bags. After the show there was a drawing for prizes. They raffled off dinners and spa passes. We didn’t win anything.\n\n\n\nWelcome show\n\n\n\n\n\nToday’s sunset"

    "text": "Monday, August 26, 2024\nI woke around 5am and made some coffee and worked on my book. Later, when Becky got up, I made scrambled eggs with potatoes and diced ham.\nAround 9am we went to the beach. The sky was clear, the wind was calm and there were some little flies buzzing around and pestering us. About an hour later the breeze picked up and little pests were gone. The temperature this morning was 90°F. The ocean condition flags were changed from red to yellow about one hour after we arrived.\nAround 11am we decided to have our picnic lunch. Lunch was ham and cheese sandwiches, chips and crackers. Becky brought down a small container of white wine and I had a can of beer. We had to be sneaky with our food and drinks because coolers and picnic baskets are not allowed on the beach. So I keep my portable cooler in my backpack and the cooler police don’t bother us. Around 2 pm we went back to the room to take our showers.\nIn the afternoon it started to get cloudy over the mountains and it looked like there were some thunderstorms forming. In the evening there was a pretty good lightning show. We saw 10 or so flashes of lightning every minute or two. Most of the time we didn’t hear any thunder so the lightning was either far away or the wind was blowing in the wrong direction. We could also see rain showers in the distance. Being up on the 8th floor we had a good view of the mountains.\nDinner tonight was chicken and rice burritos that we made in our kitchen. Later we watched a movie called, The Devil’s Peak, the movie was pretty bad. Becky said it must have been one of the movies I picked out, but I actually think she picked out that movie.\n\n\n\nThis is the adult/quiet pool, but now being used as the main pool and all day long loud music plays. The music is OK, a mix of oldies and latin pop. So far no rap music. About every two hours some kind of pool activity is hosted. Starting with water aerobics and later some trivia type games. Today’s trivia was music trivia and about half of the songs were latin. The only song we recognized was the theme song to the TV show Hawaii 5-O.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere is some construction and renovation taking place. From our balcony we have a good view of the workers. When we made our reservation we read that some buildings were going to be undergoing renovation and starting September 2nd, the main pool would be closed. We can hear some sawing and pounding. The noise isn’t bothering us and it’s interesting to watch the workers.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe sunset tonight was pretty good because of all the clouds and thunderstorms."

    "text": "Tuesday, August 27, 2024\nWhen we arrived at the beach around 9am, a lot of the beach furniture was picked up, something the staff must do every evening. So this morning we had to drag loungers and chairs to the palapala where we wanted to sit. It took Becky a while to choose one she liked and we ended up moving once. It’s kind of hard to pick one when you have like 500 to choose from.\nThe skies this morning were mostly clear with a few high wispy clouds. This morning’s temperature is 85° F. No breese and no bugs.\nThis morning the red flags are out. About an hour after we got to the beach the flags were changed to yellow. So maybe they just always put the red flags out overnight and then change them to whatever they need to be around 10am.\nOn our first beach walk of the day, Becky stepped on a bee. The bee stung her on the bottom of her foot near her big toe. I had to pull the stinger out. When we got back to our palapala, I consulted Nurse Google, who recommended putting ice on the area to reduce the swelling, assuming she wasn’t having an allergic reaction. On the positive side we did find seven pesos while on our walk. We also saw a couple other bees, so I’m not sure what they’re doing down on the beach.\nOne thing about sitting on the beach is we always get asked every 5 minutes if you want to buy something by the beach vendors. They’re always dressed in white and they sell hats, sunglasses, blankets, dresses, wood carvings, cigars, real silver jewelry, t-shirts with funny sayings like Jose Deere with a picture of a donkey instead of a tractor. Twenty minutes later the same guy comes around with the same stuff asking us if we want to buy anything.\n\n\n\nbeach vendor\n\n\nOne thing about having the main pool closed is they moved all of the activities to the adult pool. The staff set up the PA system at the quiet pool and they play music, make stupid announcements and run all sorts of activities. The announcements are given twice, once in Spanish and again in English. The music is old tunes from the ’80s, Latin pop music, some disco and techno dance music. The music would be okay except the volume is way too loud, you can’t even talk to anybody while in the pool.\nLunch was ham and cheese sandwiches and tortilla chips. Dinner tonight was tuna, mac and cheese and green beans.\nLater we watched a movie and made popcorn. I brought a HDMI cable to connect my laptop to the TV. The movie was a comedy streamed from Amazon Prime.\nAt 7pm we walked back to the beach to watch the sun set. After dark we sat on our balcony and watched the lightning from the thunder storms that built up in the afternoon.\n\n\n\nsun set"

The beach attendant was roaming around and he set up the chairs at our favorite palapala, number 206. Yesterday we were at number 306 about 10 ft away. Number 206 is nice because in addition to the palapala there are some tall palm trees which also provide shade in the morning.\nThis morning the skies are mostly clear with a few scattered high clouds. The temperature this morning is 85°. Later today there is a 40% chance of rain.\nBecky’s big toe where the bee stung her swelled up last night. This morning she is feeling better but her toe is still a little swollen. According to Nurse Google the swelling can last up to one week.\nOn our first walk down the beach today we saw more bees just crawling around on the sand by the water’s edge. I’m not sure what they were doing down there; sometimes the waves come up and wash them away. On our walk we took some pictures of the resort adjacent to us called the Occidental. Then I walked as far as the Hard Rock Resort. On the way back I found 10 pesos. I’m not sure why there are Mexican pesos just lying in the sand. So far we found 17 pesos, about $1 USD.\n\n\n\nOccidental\n\n\n\n\n\npalm tree shadows\n\n\nWe finished up at the beach around 2:15 and went back to the room for showers. The plan is to stop by the main lobby to check on our room charges and go to the bank to get some pesos for the taxi ride back to the airport on Saturday.\nOur room charges were correct. We then walked to the Mall, about 10 minutes away. We were surprised to see they had a nice big laundromat and food court with McDonald’s, Subway and 5 or 6 other restaurants. Next door to the mall was a Citibanamex Bank with three ATMs. So I withdrew 500 pesos ($23 USD). The taxi to the airport for 1 to 4 passengers is 240 pesos ($12.22 USD).\nThe movie tonight was “I am Celin Dion”, a documentary about her health problems.\n\n\n\nsun set 1\n\n\n\n\n\nsun set 2"

The weather forecast for today: 88°F, humidity 58%, Scattered thunderstorms. Chance of rain 50%. Last night at about 1 am there was a big thunderstorm with rain.\nBreakfast was coffee and granola for me and Becky had oatmeal. We did not pack lunch since the plan is to have lunch at the resort’s buffet.\nToday we are at palapala #403. The palapalas are laid out in a 8 by 45 grid with some missing areas for the restaurants, towel shack and volleyball court. So there are around 300 palapalas to choose from.\nI went swimming in the ocean today and the water is very warm. The ocean water is even warmer than the pool and I think the pool is too warm. I wish the pool was just a smidge cooler because it’s not really that refreshing.\n\n\n\nThunderheads looking south\n\n\nThunderstorms forming over the mountains. Typical weather pattern for this time of the year is afternoon thunderstorms and here’s an example of a big thunder head over the mountains.\nWe finished up our vitamin sunshine therapy around 1:30 p.m. and came inside to take our showers and get ready to have lunch either at the resort’s buffet or at a restaurant in the mall. When we went back to our room, it had not been made up for the day as it had been on other days.\nOur plans for lunch were a bust. The resort is not running their lunch buffet today and I was really looking forward to having at least five plates of food and dessert. After looking at the reviews for the restaurants in the nearby mall, we decided to have lunch at the beach restaurant where we had tacos earlier in the week. Lunch was 768 pesos including tax and tip ($39 USD).\nBecky ordered the fish tacos and I ordered the tacos El pastor (pork). Becky had a slushy drink called a Rocky and I had a Mexican beer, and we shared a plate of onion rings for starters.\n\n\n\nlunch drinks\n\n\nThe Rocky is made from rum, vodka, mango, grenadine, lime juice and simple syrup.\nThe movie tonight was Invisible Man streamed from Amazon Prime.\nAt 7pm we walked down to the beach to watch the sun set.

Chance of rain 50%.\nThis morning we are back at palapala #403. The skies are mostly clear with a few high clouds and some thunderheads in the distance.\n\n\n\nthunderheads looking north\n\n\nAround 10:20 am we went to swim in the pool. We were talking to a guest who is from Riverside when we saw the pool concierge walk around the pool asking people in the pool who’s towels are these? Then he held up a boogie board that was left on one of the loungers and asked if this belonged to anybody. He was picking up items that people had left on chairs and loungers in order to reserve them.\nThen we saw a guy from his third or fourth floor balcony yelling at the pool guy in Spanish, but the pool concierge didn’t hear him. A few minutes later he came running down and then he and the pool concierge got in an argument in Spanish. I really couldn’t understand what was being said, but the man took his boogie board and towel back to “his” umbrella and threw them down on “his” lounge chair. As he was walking back to his room and pool concierge was finishing his walk around the pool, they met up again and they had another real long conversation also in Spanish. Maybe the gist of it was, “hey, you know everyone else is reserving chairs, why are you picking on me?” Then the guy goes back inside.\nWe had fun discussing all the drama with some of the other guests in the pool. None of us spoke Spanish well enough or could hear what was said, so we were just imagining and making up stuff about how the conversation was going. Anyway, the pool concierge walked off with two or three towels that he had collected from chairs that people were trying to reserve.\nWe had ham and cheese sandwiches for lunch with chips. I had a beer. Becky had a canned cocktail that we had bought from WinCo. She also had a half a glass of white wine.\nLater in the afternoon, we were entertained by about 20 birds who were helping themselves to a plate of french fries left at one of the palapalas when the guests went to swim in the ocean. The feeding frenzy ended when one of the waiters picked up the plate of mostly pecked over fries and took it away.\nBefore dinner we stopped by the front desk to check on our room charges, since we will be leaving tomorrow, we don’t want any surprises. Dinner tonight was tuna noodle casserole and other leftovers.\nAround 7pm we went out to watch the sunset. There was a lot of thunder and lightning and a little bit of rain in the area. The lifeguard made everyone get out of the ocean because of the nearby lighting. The flashes were very bright and I was keeping an eye out to see if I thought they were close, but the lighting was cloud to cloud from what I could see.\nWe noticed down the beach, off in the distance, that something kind of big had washed up. So we walked down to have a look, especially since some of the hotel staff were also down there. It turned out to be a large dead turtle.

    "text": "Saturday, August 31, 2024\nBreakfast was scrambled egg burritos with refried beans and leftover rice. Since I was up early, I had two cups of coffee, some stale cookies and a granola bar.\nAfter breakfast I washed the dishes, did some final packing and tidying up. By 10:15am all our suitcases were packed and we’re just waiting in our room. I checked the Uber app and the price to the airport this morning is 230 pesos. The posted rate for a taxi is 250 pesos (a one US dollar difference). Taking the Uber requires schlepping our bags and a 5 minute walk to exit the resort (Uber is not allowed on to the resort for pickups).\nWhen we were in the lobby of our building the bellboy approached us to take our bags. I was walking over Becky’s bag to the main building, because I was making two trips. He said they don’t allow a lot of luggage in the lobby, so I said okay and that I need to get the rest of our bags. So back up the elevator I went to get the remainder of our bags.\nAt checkout, our wrist bands were cut off, we signed our bill and received two tags required to exit the resort. One tag to give to the bellboy that allowed us to retrieve our bags and the other tag for the guard shack. We waited in the lobby about 40 minutes before leaving the resort. Our resort charges were 1,137 pesos ($57 USD). I’ll have to check my credit card in a few days because when we checked in, a 10,000 peso ($500 USD) hold was applied to my card.\nWe left the resort about 11:55 am and arrived at the airport about 20 minutes later. We had a 40 minute wait for the Alaska counter to open. We were 1st in line.\nAfter checking our bags, we headed through security where we had to scan our boarding passes before our carry-ons were x-rayed.\nAt the airport there are two VIP lounges that we can access with the Chase Sapphire Credit Card. The first one was full, so we were offered a golf cart ride to the second, larger lounge. Getting a ride on the golf cart was kind of fun, but it seemed kind of slow, since we could only go as fast as people were walking through the narrow passageways.\nWe stayed at the VIP lounge for about one and a half hours. I had a beer and Becky had a Mai Tai. The food was a combination of mini burritos, chicken noodle soup and chicken chow mein. Later Becky had an espresso Martini, which she didn’t like, so I drank some of it and it wasn’t too bad.\nOur meals on the flight home were chicken and rice for me; Becky had the shrimp pasta. I finished my movie (Dune part 2). Afterwards I listen to some music and read my book.\nWe arrived at the LAX baggage carousel at around 6:30pm. After about 15 bags came down the belt, it got jammed. One and a half hours later, it was fixed and we got our final bag. At 8:30pm we were on the bus to Van Nuys. The Traffic from Van Nuys to Ventura was light and we arrived home at 10:30 pm.\nOur stay at the resort was very relaxing. This was the 3rd time we have stayed at this resort and I would come back here again. The staff at the resort is very attentive and friendly. About half of the guests are Mexican Nationals. Last time, there were a lot of Canadians here, this time most of the English speakers were American.\nOur next trip is in 22 days, a cruise on Oceania Riviera, round trip, departing San Pedro to San Francisco for seven days."

    "text": "Becky and I are on a seven night cruise from Los Angeles on Oceania Regatta (670-passengers, built in 1998). The cruise will stop at Catalina Island, San Francisco (overnight) and Ensenada, Mexico; and we will have two sea days. This will be our first cruise on Oceania Cruise lines.\nThe drive to the port of San Pedro took a little over two hours to cover the 82 miles from Ventura to the port in San Pedro during the weekday morning traffic. Google maps was reporting two accidents along Highway 101 in the San Fernando Valley and suggested an alternate route along Highway 1, which we took. The traffic was light until we reached Malibu and from there it was congested until Santa Monica.\nWe arrived at the cruise terminal parking lot around 10:20am and the lot was mostly empty, which was surprising. The Regatta was the only cruise ship in port and she had just finished a 13 day cruise from Vancouver to Los Angeles. We unloaded the car and rolled our bags to the terminal. We dropped our one check-on suitcase with the porters, fingers crossed that we would see it again later in the day. We’ve disembarked at the port of San Pedro many times before, usually at terminal 92, but this time our ship was docked at terminal 93 and the terminal layout is a bit different. We each had a small roll-on suitcase as our carry-on, and after security and x-ray of our bags, we took the elevator upstairs to the second floor to check-in. We were shown to a seating area to wait for check in to start at 11am.\nNo one at the check in counters. At 10:45am the check in desk started to get set up. Waiting for our group to be called.\nMost of the passengers were older than us. I think anyone we saw that was our age or younger, were adult children traveling with their parents.\nThe boarding is by cabin category - penthouse suites and above are the first group, the second group is concierge verandas followed by all other staterooms. Concierge veranda cabins are just regular balcony cabins with some added extras, such as, boarding in the second group, free laundry service and a welcome bottle of Champagne. The only reason to board early as possible is to secure additional reservations in the specialty restaurants, or so we thought.\nThe first group called was for guests in owner and vista suites. Only about six guests got up and the second group was for penthouse suites, which was our group. Check in took a little bit of time since the girl wasn’t familiar with the software and couldn’t scan our passports. After getting our ship key cards, we went to have our carryon bags x-rayed and walk through the metal detectors. From there we were able to board the ship.\nOur first stop was to the restaurant reservation desk to inquire about getting an additional restaurant reservation. Contrary to what we read on the internet, additional speciality reservations are not allowed.\nThe choices for embarkation lunch are either at Waves Grill or Terrace Café. Waves Grill is the pool deck burger bar and Terrace Café is the buffet. We headed to Waves Grill to get a table. The Waves Grill and Terrace Café are very near each other so food can easily be carried from one place to the other.\nBecky ordered the Surf & Turf sandwich - grilled Florida lobster medallions, sliced black angus filet mignon, tomato, toasted ciabatta, roasted garlic jus and remoulade dipping sauce. On the side came french fries and coleslaw.\nI ordered the Oceania Cuban sandwich – slow roasted marinated pork, ham, Swiss cheese, dill pickles, mustard, grilled Cuban bread with french fries.\nSince we didn’t have much for breakfast before leaving home, we were somewhat hungry. Becky thought her sandwich was just so-so. It was kind of hard for her to eat as a sandwich and she didn’t care for the bun. So she just scraped the lobster and filet mignon off the bread and ate the filling by itself, which she liked. So she ordered a second sandwich without the bread. I had a taste of lobster and filet mignon and they were good. My Cuban sandwich was good.\nSince our cabins were not ready, we decided to wait at Waves Grill, so I then ordered a strawberry milkshake - two scoops of whole milk ice cream and whipped cream. Then I walked over to the buffet to get a dessert, which Becky and I shared. By then it was about 12:30pm and Becky went off to explore while I waited with our carry on bags at the Waves Bar.\nShe came back only after a few minutes and said the doors to the cabin hallways were open, so we took that as a sign that our cabin was ready even though no announcements had been made. Outside our cabin we found our checked luggage waiting for us. Now it was time for us to check out our cabin, unpack and organize our stuff.\nLater, as we went out to explore the ship we met our butler, Richard, in the hallway along with our cabin attendant, Karen. The ship is not very big, so it didn’t take long to visit the library, casino, card room, internet office, Horizons lounge, spa. We also stopped by reception to inquire about some missing on board credit. We need to make a trip back to the room to get a printout from the booking agent showing our amenities, so that the office could follow up and make an inquiry back to headquarters.\nIn the afternoon, we ordered some room service snacks to have with our champagne. We ordered the Spinach and Artichoke Dip – crème fraiche, tomato salsa and tortilla chips; and a cheese plate – chutney, bread, crackers. The champagne was good, the nicest I’ve had in a long time. Often we have a bottle of bubbly waiting in our cabin when we check in, but it is usually something cheap, so Becky mixes it with OJ and I don’t even bother drinking it.\nDinner was in the Grand Dining Room which is what the main dining room is called on this ship. Dinner service started at 6pm and guests started to line up about 10 minutes early. When we got into line, there were about 20 people ahead of us. Menus change daily with a choice of 13 appetizers, soups and salads, 9 dinner entrées and 7 dessert items. In addition there are three suggested course pairings of the appetizer, second course, entree and dessert with a different theme each night. There is the Food & Wine pairing, the Global Cuisine lineup and the Aquamar Vitality Cuisine lineup. If you order the food and wine pairing, you don’t have to get the wine. These suggested pairings are a nice way to try different themed menus without having to think about things too much and experience items that I would not normally gravitate to. The Aquamar Vitality Cuisine consists of vegetarian selections and other plant-based dishes similar to a Mediterranean diet; and only for this line up are the calories, fat grams and grams of fiber listed. All the menu items have a little symbol next to the description which indicates if it is lacto-ovo vegetarian, plant-based or no-sugar-added.\nEarlier in the day, when we were out exploring the ship, we took some photos of the dining room.\nBecky ordered the following … Appetizer: chilled shrimp – horseradish spiked cocktail sauce Soup & salad: cream of cauliflower – with chicken quenelles. Didn’t get a photo of the soup. Entrée: Pork tenderloin medallions – asparagus, crabmeat, hollandaise sauce, gratinated polenta Dessert: vanilla soufflé with a cup of decaf Cappuccino.\nBecky didn’t like her entree that much. She also didn’t care for the dessert souffle. She gave it a rating of 4 out of 10 forks and didn’t finish her dinner or dessert.\nMy dinner order was … Appetizer: Roasted butternut squash – arugula, black radish, mango, hearts of palm Soup & salad: Sicilian salad - baby greens, onions, tomatoes, Italian black olives, capers, red wine vinaigrette Entrée: Tamarid-braised hamachi fillet – sweet ginger sauce, steamed rice, stir-fried vegetables Dessert: Mango sweet sticky rice with decaf Cappuccino\nI liked my dinner selections, I gave it 7 out of 10 forks. The roasted butternut squash was very nice and the pairing with the mango was good. The salad was typical. The fish for the main course reminded me of snapper. I didn’t care for the mango sweet sticky rice and I only ate half of it. I ordered it because I wanted to try new items. Besides, if I wanted more, I could always visit the buffet for my second dinner.\nAfter dinner we went to the show, called, ‘Broadway in Concert Starring the Regatta production singers, … lullabies of Broadway’. The performance was good and the singers were excellent. We didn’t know too many of the songs.\nOur cabin is a Penthouse Suite on deck 8 and has an advertised size of 322 square feet. The width of the cabin is about 4 feet wider than a standard balcony cabin which allows for a desk, chair and storage on the wall opposite from the bed while leaving ample room to walk around the bed. The closet is by the entry and has three doors with space for hanging clothes, some shelves and a room safe large enough to hold a laptop. In the closet are cotton bathrobes, slippers and cashmere lap blankets which can be used on the veranda during cold weather.\nThe bathroom has a shower stall, one sink with counter space on each side and storage behind the mirrors. The size of the bathroom is small and really only one person at a time can use the bathroom. The bath amenities are by Bulgari, which are the body wash, hair shampoo/conditioner and moisturizing lotion. I’m not a fan of the Bulgari products since I don’t like their scent.\nOutside the floor-to-ceiling windows and sliding glass door is a balcony with two chairs and a small table. The deck chairs can recline and are comfortable. The large windows that frame the ocean side of the cabin provide lots of light and nice views.\nAlso in the room is a television with on demand movies, ship’s information (map, weather, route, speed etc.) and our guest account balance.\nWhen we arrived at our cabin on the first day a bottle of Champagne was chilling in the ice bucket along with a complimentary Oceania Cruises logo tote bag.\nWe are bringing two bottles of wine and small containers of gin and bourbon from home. Oceania allows guests to bring up to six bottles of wine onboard to enjoy in their stateroom; or guests can pay a corkage fee and bring their wine to dinner or the public areas of the ship. Given that we can bring alcoholic beverages from home, we didn’t purchase a beverage package. Any drinks we purchase at the bars will be out of pocket. We plan to drink our cheap wine in our room.\nThe small room fridge is restocked daily with soft drinks and water. In the fridge we found Sprite which Becky wanted and there was a can of tonic water along with other assorted other sodas. I wanted the tonic water so that I could make gin and tonics. I don’t really like the taste of gin that much, so I dilute my gin with vodka. Besides cutting the flavor of gin, vodka is also good for spot cleaning clothes. Who knew that vodka was the universal solvent? Our butler said he would bring extras of whatever soda we liked.\nTwo bottles of water are provided to the room and replenished. The water is still Vero Water. Also provided are two stainless steel water bottles for use around the ship and to take home. Vero water is normal ship’s water that has been processed by a filtration system made by Vero. Vero’s purification and bottling process enables the ship to purify, chill, fill, and serve unlimited still and sparkling water on-site and on demand.\nOur cabin doesn’t have a coffee maker; 24 hour room service and 24 hour butler service is available, so in room coffee is available only by delivery via room service. The room service menu for penthouses suites is an expanded menu. Some cruise lines have started to charge for room service, but it’s included on Oceania. The butler service includes set up of in-suite dining, delivery of canapes (afternoon hors d’oeuvre) along with many other services that we don’t utilize such as packing and unpacking of our suitcases, garment pressing and shoe shine service.\nUnlimited WiFi for one device at a time is included in the fare. Becky and I aren’t big users of WiFi so we can easily have just one device connected at a time. I measured the WiFi speed, and it was about 4 Mbps for download and 2 Mbps for upload. When I’m in port, I use my mobile phone to connect to the internet and I get 52 Mbps of download speed and 38 Mbps of upload speed.\nBelgian chocolates are delivered with the nightly turndown service. We save these and bring them home.\nA complementary iPad upon request is available, which we didn’t ask for.\nAll the cabins have a daily service charge (the gratuity or tip), of $18 per person charged to the room. This covers services provided by the cabin steward, waiters and some of the other crew members. Additionally, there is a service charge of 20% added to drinks and spa services. Since we are staying in a penthouse there is an additional service charge of $5 per person per day for the butler.\nOverall, the room is very nice, with a coffee table, small dining table, vanity desk, sofa bed, large floor to ceiling windows and a sliding glass door leading to the balcony.\nWhen we leave our room in the morning for breakfast, we put a small card outside on the door and the attendant knows we are out and can make up the room. By the time we finish breakfast the room is done. The cabin is serviced twice per day, with the second service normally occurring while we are out for dinner and the show."

    "text": "Oceania Regatta – day 2\nToday’s port is the town of Avalon on Catalina Island. Catalina Island is located about 29 miles south-southwest of Long Beach, California. The island’s population is around 4,000 people and most of them live in the city of Avalon. At day break the ship was anchored about a mile offshore. I was up early, took my shower and went off to get some coffee, while Becky took her shower. Morning coffee is available at the Terrace Cafe, deck 9 (one deck up), the Horizons bar, deck 10 (two decks up) or at Baristas Bar, three decks down on deck 5. This morning I decided to visit Baristas to have an Americano and a biscotti. The coffee shop opens at 6:30am and I was there about ten minutes before opening, so I set up my laptop with a table in the corner. There were a few others also waiting, with most getting coffee to go.\nBreakfast today was in the main dining room, but first we stopped at the coffee shop so that Becky could order a latte and a biscotti. For breakfast I ordered avocado toast which came with poached eggs. Becky had an omelet with a steak. We shared the steak since it was a bigger piece and more than Becky wanted. My poached eggs were cooked as I ordered them, well done, since I don’t like runny eggs. The avocado tasted a bit under ripe to me.\nAfter breakfast, we took the ship’s tender ashore for a little walk around town. The tender process on this ship requires those going ashore to stop by the theater and pick up colored tickets and wait for your group to be called. We didn’t have long to wait, maybe two or three minutes. The tender ride to shore took about 15 minutes and the seas were calm. The weather was cool and overcast.\nOur last visit to Avalon was probably 40 years ago. The town is a tourist beach town with a nice beach and shops and restaurants along Crescent Ave, which is a pedestrian promenade between the store fonts and the beach. We didn’t have any activities planned, so we walked along the street that runs along the beach and did some window shopping and took a few photos. The weather was overcast and the temperature was about 70F.\nThere is a nice beach and the water is very clear. Avalon has an underwater dive park and the giant kelp forests are world famous.\nWe had lunch in the buffet, called Terrace Cafe. The buffet is small compared to the larger ships we have been on and many of the items are the same as served in the main dining room. Seating is available both inside and outside on the rear lido deck. It’s at the buffet where the ship can get very crowded, especially at the start of meal times, when a lot of guests want to eat. Even though the passenger count is low, the number of tables in the buffet can’t accommodate the demand and people hoover around waiting to snag an empty table as soon as one frees up. Today they were serving crab cake sandwiches which sounded good.\nAfter lunch we put on our swimsuits and went to the Aquamare Spa sundeck, which is an exclusive area for suite guests and those with spa appointments. The spa sundeck has three sun beds and about six lounge chairs. The main attraction is the large Thalassotherapy Pool, basically a large hot tub. When we arrived there were only two other guests. So we had the hot tube and left side of the sun deck to ourselves. We stayed about an hour.\nThe next event was a mini golf and shuffleboard tournament held on the sports deck. At these events guests earn ‘O’ points, which are redeemable at the end of the cruise for prizes. We putted on holes 3, 6 and 9 and kept track of the number of puts and got points based on par.\nWe are also doing the art scavenger hunt. The object is to find the location of 60 works of art located around the ship based on visual clues on the answer sheet. This was a lot of fun and it took us a couple of days to find the locations, with the help of other passengers and some crew.\nOur canape order for today was California rolls and crudites with hummus.\nAt 5pm the captain hosted a welcome aboard party and the officers and top staff were introduced. During the party hors d’oeuvre were served and drinks at three of the bars were complementary from 5 until 8. So after our first welcome drink, we took a glass of wine to dinner.\nTonight’s dinner was at the Polo Grill, which is the steak house on the Regatta. Reservations are required for this restaurant, which Becky made prior to sailing since all reservation times are usually taken by the first day of the cruise. The cost of the restaurant is included in the cruise fare and there is no up-charge for lobster or other items as is typical on NCL. The menu is extensive with choices of 5 starter items, 4 soups, 5 salads, 6 cuts of beef (Porterhouse, Rib Eye, Filet Mignon, Bone-in Prime Rib), Pork Rib Chop, Grilled Rack of Lamb, Rotisserie Chicken. There are also five Signature dishes, six seafood dishes and 12 dessert choices. I didn’t snap any photos of our dinner items. We had a nice table for two next to the window.\nThe table next to us was a table for four. About 10 minutes after we were seated, a couple was seated at this table and the husband started to sit down across from the wife and she said to him, “not there, over here”, indicating that he should sit next to her. “But why?”, he said, “I want to sit here”. “Because we are sharing”, she said. “What?” “This is a sharing table”, she said a little louder. As soon as they were seated, the hostess brought over another couple, and they proceeded to have an awkward conversation in front of everyone. “I didn’t know we were sharing”, he said. “Yes, we’re sharing a table tonight”, she answered. Then they sat down and proceeded with introductions around the table. So apparently the husbands didn’t get the memo that dinner that night would be with strangers. During the course of the meal, the wife from the second couple dominated the conversation and seemed delighted to have someone else to talk to.\nThe problem with a small ship is that some venues don’t have enough seating capacity to accommodate all the guests. Seating in the buffet and at the specialty restaurants are the primary examples. Guests in penthouse suites and above can book dining reservations ahead of everyone else. So on the first day that the reservation window opened up, Becky made our reservations and secured tables for two at the specialty restaurants at our normal dining times. When the booking window opened for everyone else, I suspect that all the desirable times and preferred table sizes were no longer available.\nFor dinner tonight, Becky ordered … Appetizer: Colossal Chilled Shrimp Trio with Spicy Cocktail Sauce Soup & salad: New England Clam Chowder Entrée: Grilled Colorado Rack of Lamb (12 oz) with a side of Lobster Mac & Cheese Dessert: The Polo Quintet which consisted of bite size selections of the Executive Chef’s Favorite Desserts - Chocolate Fudge Brownie, Key Lime Pie, Caramelized New York Cheesecake, Crème Brûlée and Granny Smith Apple Crumb Pie Becky thought the shrimp trio was so-so. Everything else she liked. According to her, the dinner was 8 out of 10 forks.\nI ordered … Appetizer: Apple Cider Marinated, Slow-Roasted Pork Belly with Honey Soy Sauce Soup & salad: Beefsteak Tomato and Sweet Onion Salad Entrée: Filet Mignon (7 oz) with Hollandaise sauce and a side of onion rings Dessert: Key Lime Pie with Florida Orange Butter Sauce I like all my selections, except the Slow-Roasted Pork Belly. The Pork Belly was kind of bland tasting. I gave tonight’s dinner 6 out of 10 forks. The food was good, the steak cooked just as I ordered it and the Key Lime Pie was very good. But overall, I wasn’t blown away by the dining experience. It was on par with the steak house on the NCL ships. I suppose if I were a fan of lobster or something like a King’s Cut (32 oz) Bone-in Prime Rib, which are available without an up charge, unlike on NCL, then I would have awarded additional forks to my rating.\nThe show tonight was ‘Magic, fun and laughter’, which we didn’t attend.\n\n\n\nview of Regatta from tender\n\n\n\n\n\nbuffet\n\n\n\n\n\nart scavenger hunt sheet\n\n\n\n\n\nafternoon snacks\n\n\n\n\n\nscuba divers on the steps\n\n\n\n\n\nbreakfast poached eggs and avacodo toast\n\n\n\n\n\nloungers on the spa\n\n\n\n\n\nspa\n\n\n\n\n\nbeach in Catalina\n\n\n\n\n\nsidewalk in Cataline"

    "text": "Oceania Regatta – day 3\nToday is a sea day and we are en route to San Francisco. I got up early as I normally do, took my shower and went out to get some coffee. This morning I decided to visit the Horizon lounge and make a cup of coffee using the self service coffee machines. Later when Becky was ready, we went to Barista’s to get Becky’s morning cappuccino and I had a cup of Americano with a biscotti. Breakfast this morning was in the Grand Dining Room. I had a small bowl of Greek yogurt along with scrambled eggs, hash browns and a side of bacon. Becky had oatmeal followed by French Toast.\nI really like the Americano coffee from these machines. In fact, I prefer the coffee here over the coffee made in Barista’s coffee bar.\nA wide angle view of Barista’s Coffee bar. Barista’s is located just outside the Grand Dining Room and is a nice place to meet for coffee before breakfast. Here you can order lattes and bring them into the dining room for breakfast. In the dining room, only drip coffee or cappuccino are served. In the afternoon, some alcoholic beverages are available from Barista’s. I think it was limited to wine, champagne and regular martinis.\nOur first activity of the morning was miniature golf in the Horizon’s lounge, immediately followed by bean bag toss. About 50 guests showed up for this event. The main reason to attend is to collect ‘O’ points and chit-chat with fellow cruisers. For miniature golf, the staff had set up three holes and you got three chances to make a hole, with one point earned for each hole. Becky and I can usually make two or three holes. The bean bag (or corn hole as it’s sometimes called) is more challenging. Two guests go at a time and compete against each other, with the winner getting two points and the loser getting one.\nThree puts are allowed at each hole. Points range from three to one, where zero holes will still earn you one point.\nAfter mini golf, we worked on the art scavenger hunt, which we really enjoyed. I like looking at art and the scavenger hunt really forced you to look at all the pieces in detail, because the clue was usually just a small snippet taken from a section of the art, sculpture, photo or signage. Most of the art on the ship is abstract and much of it looks very similar to the abstract art we have seen on other Norwegian ships.\nA painting was in the stairway between decks 3 and 4. The clue was a snippet of the buildings near the top of the painting.\nThe vase was on deck 10, near the aft elevators and the clue was a photo of just the tip top of the vase.\nWe had lunch in the Terrace Cafe (the ship’s buffet) located on the aft lido deck. Seating areas line the windows port and starboard. At the back, doors lead to an outdoor seating area with round tables for four, topped by umbrellas. In most instances servers will dish out your foods rather than letting you help yourself. All three meals are served here. Lunch and dinner choices include items on the main dining room menu, so at least for lunch and dinner, the food varies. Today’s theme for the lunch menu was Mexican and it was very crowded when it opened.\nBuffet indoor seating. During busy times, you need to grab your table and put down your jacket, book or something to hold your table before going off to get your food. Or just wait for about an hour after opening and by then the feeding frenzy would have subsided.\nAfter lunch we wandered around the ship working on the art scavenger hunt. The Regatta is the smallest cruise ship we have been on. The only other small cruise ship we have experienced was on our first cruise back in 1992, on NCL’s Southward, a 802 passenger vessel. The Regatta can carry 670 passengers and has a crew of 386. Exploring a new ship is kind of fun and doing the art scavenger hunt was a fun excuse to wander around. There are nine decks open to passengers, starting with deck 3 and going to deck 11. Deck 3 has about 15 ocean view cabins (143 to 165 square feet in size).\nDeck 4 has the Reception Desk, Destination Services, the Concierge, the Medical Center and ocean view and inside cabins (160 square feet). About eight of the paintings or sculptures on this deck were part of the art scavenger hunt.\nDeck 5 has the main dining room called the Grand Dining Room, a coffee shop called Baristas & The Grand Bar, the shops, a martini bar called Martinis, the casino and main stage called the Lounge. Several art scavenger hunt items were in the Grand Dining Room and Baristas. Fabric pattern on the dining room chairs and the design on the carpet were items we needed to locate.\nThe lobby for the ship spanned two floors, with a ‘grand’ staircase connecting the two levels. On most days, a stringed quartet would play, and the selections ranged from pop melodies to well known classics. I would think to myself, “I know that song … that’s ‘Let it Be’, by the Beatles.”\nThis is the martini bar, called Martini’s and is also the casino bar. We planned to have drinks here during the cruise, but we never made it. During happy hour, when two for one drinks were served, it was always full.\nMore scavenger hunt art was behind the piano in Martini’s bar. In the evening someone would play and sing songs. But we were always busy doing other stuff, usually having a long dinner, so we never got the chance to have a drink here and listen to the music.\nThe casino is small with about 50 slot machines, one roulette, three blackjack tables and one poker table. There was one art scavenger hunt item in the casino and it was on one of the slot machines.\nThe main stage is were three or four art scavenger hunt items were in here.\nOn decks 6, 7 and 8 there are cabins of various categories - Owners suites (1000 square feet), Vista suites (786 square feet), penthouse suites (322 square feet), veranda (216 square feet) and inside cabins.\nDeck 9 has the buffet called the Terrace Café, an outdoors burger bar called Waves Bar & Grill, the lido deck where the pool and two hot tubs are located, the ships spa called Aquamar, the internet center and the card room.\nHere is a view of the pool deck and jogging track on decks 9 and 10. The pool is small, but I never saw more than three people in it. On the last day of the cruise, Becky and I took a dip in the pool, the water was warm and the depth of the pool was maybe four and a half feet deep. All the loungers around the pool have terry cloth covers and the cushions on the daybeds and loungers are comfortable. There were always loungers available both in the sun and in the shade. This is in stark contrast to the other cruise ships we’ve been on, where the pool deck is packed and chair hogs reserve loungers early in the morning with books and personal beach towels.\nWe found more scavenger hunt art in the card room. This room was often full of passengers playing card or board games.\nDeck 10 has the Italian restaurant called Toscana, the steak house called Polo Grill, the library, fitness track and the forward observation lounge called Horizons. The scavenger hunt art located in Toscana, and the Polo Grill could not be accessed during the day because the doors were closed.\nLibrary has polished dark wood on the walls and a mural on the ceiling which is painted to look like the sky with some tropical trees and birds. There is a faux fireplace with umbrella stands on either side. There were several scavenger hunt art items in the library.\nThere are some leather chairs in the library and they must be extremely comfortable because on many days, I saw passengers sleeping here.\nOn deck 11 is the sports deck with shuffleboard and golf putting greens as well as a sun deck.\nOn the outdoor putting green each hole was par 3 and we would count the number of strokes to get three holes. The staff would typically pick holes 1, 3 and 7 for the group to do, that way several golfers could be working the course at once.\nShuffleboard was hard to do. All my shots were either long or too short.\nWe worked on the art scavenger hunt until it was time for the bracelet craft hour. We sat with Laurie, who we had met earlier when doing the scavenger hunt. The bracelet craft was a small kit consisting of beads and a short length of elastic string.\nAt 4pm tea is served in the horizon lounge. A selection of traditional and herbal teas were served while a string quartet played softly on the stage. The staff brought around pastry carts filled with finger sandwiches, petits fours, scones with whipped cream and jam along with other desserts. The daily variety of finger sandwiches were good. The carrot curry and shrimp avocado sandwiches were unusual and really good. Everything on the pastry carts looked good and all my selections tasted really good, unlike on NCL where often the desserts can look good but don’t really taste as good as they look. Bill and Laurie joined us for tea. They are from Springfield Missouri, Bill is 56 and Laurie just turned 60. We ran into Bill and Laurie on the first day when I saw them doing the art scavenger hunt.\nBill is a college instructor and teaches Library Science courses. He was usually busy in the morning doing zoom meetings. Laurie carried her knitting and craft projects with her and was always working on something.\nAfter tea we went back to our room to relax and change into our dinner clothes. But first, I went to the trivia event, also where you can earn ‘O’ points, but only the top three teams are awarded points. Up to six people can be on a team and it looked like most of the teams had already been established before the cruise. I found out later that repeat Oceania cruisers organize their teams on Facebook ahead of the cruise. So I just played solo, since I wouldn’t be playing any more trivia on this cruise. There were 15 questions with one bonus question worth two points. The top score was 12, I was able to get five correct answers.\nWe had dinner in the Grand Dining Room with Bill and Laurie and later we went to the show, which was a tribute to Motown. The singers were very good and the show was entertaining. The singers and dancers have other duties such as running the mini-golf, bean bag and shuffle board activities."

    "text": "Oceania Regatta – day 4: San Francisco\nThis morning the Regatta sailed under the Golden Gate Bridge into San Francisco Bay in the darkness of early morning. I was up in Horizon’s Lounge having my morning coffee as we approached the entrance to the bay.\nLater Becky and I stopped by Barista’s for Becky’s latte and Laurie was also there having coffee. I had a second cup of coffee along with a small biscotti. After a few minutes, Bill joined us and the girls ordered a second latte to take to breakfast.\nThis is the display case for selfservice cookies, pastries and small sandwiches in the afternoon. This photo was taken later in the day and you can see the small sandwiches.\nAfter breakfast Becky and I stopped by our room to freshen up before heading upstairs to the Horizon’s Lounge for the morning session of mini golf and bean bag. I discussed our plans for the day with Bill and they agreed to accompany us on a hike to Coit Tower. Coit Tower is a 210-foot tower in the Telegraph Hill neighborhood which overlooks the city and the bay. The tower was a short half mile walk uphill from the pier where the Regatta docked. None of us had been to the tower before.\nLooking out the windows in the Horizon Lounge at the docks and buildings we could see a tall narrow tower on the top of the hill which is the Coit Tower.\nFrom the top of the tower looking north, you can see the Regatta at dock and Alcatraz Island in the bay.\nLooking west, we could see a park and bell towers of a church, so we decided to walk over that way.\nOn the way back to the waterfront we came to a farmers market. I bought a bottle of wine and Bill bought a bottle of balsamic vinegar.\nAfternoon canapes are delivered by our butler. We can select two items from a list of 10, which we put out in the morning. The snack arrived about 5pm each day which we would have with a small glass of wine before going out for dinner.\nVegetable spring rolls with sweet chili sauce on the left and Mezze Platter – Hummus, Falafel, Spanakopita, Pita bread and Tzatziki on the right.

    "text": "Oceania Regatta – day 5\nToday the Regatta is tied to the pier in San Francisco until 9pm. We had breakfast with Bill and Laurie and then we all went upstairs to play mini golf and bean bag; we needed to work on earning our daily quota of ‘O’ points. Bill and Laurie had plans to do more exploring of San Francisco. Becky and I had a few things to do on board.\nBack at the room I called AARP to inquire about our missing on-board credit. We didn’t get a satisfactory answer from them. We then put on our swimsuits and headed up one floor to Aquamare Spa. The hot tub has been very hot and we can only spend about five to ten minutes in there. Since the Regatta is a small ship the spa is also small. The men’s locker room has two small showers and a steam room. On the larger NCL ships when we have been given access to the spa facilities, I’ve used the shower and sauna and they are stocked with men’s bath products. I didn’t see any shampoo or soap in the men’s shower, which I thought was unusual. They did have two small baskets of cheap plastic combs and disposable razors for guests to take and use.\nWe had lunch at Wave’s Grill and I had the Cuban sandwich again. Becky repeated the steak and lobster without the bread. Back in the room Becky watched a movie and I took a nap. At 2pm we went up to deck 11 to play mini golf on the outside course and then at 4pm we joined Bill and Laurie for afternoon tea.\nTonight’s dinner was at Toscana, the Italian dinner-only venue. Reservations are required and there is no charge to dine here. The restaurant is in an L-shaped room lined with windows, facing either port or aft. The decor is elegant with beige brocade napery and Versace china rimmed in blue with gold scrolls. The menu is extensive, printed on one page with small letters and is divided into sections. Reading glasses are definitely required. It’s such a large menu with so many interesting selections that it was hard to choose what to have. There is also an Olive Oil and Balsamic Vinegar menu with 10 olive oils and three balsamic vinegars. These are poured onto a small plate for dipping the bread into. The bread basket has a tempting selection of different types of focaccia, breadsticks and little cheese-covered rolls. The olive oil and balsamic vinegar choices were described by the server as ‘fruity’, ‘earthy’ or something else, maybe ‘light’, I don’t remember. He didn’t offer any choices for the balsamic vinegar. I chose the ‘fruity’, which was a darker green than what Becky chose. The bread basket placed at our table also had a clove of roasted garlic.\nBecky had reserved a table, which was by the window. The restaurant was mostly full and we noticed that some guests were offered a sharing table or a two topper against the back wall. Even though these tables were technically two toppers, they were placed so close together that you might as well be sharing. Other guests who came later sat at a four topper, but did have to share.\nBecky’s selections for dinner were … Appetizer: Code di Scampi avvolte nel Prosciutto Crudo di Parma - Sautéed Jumbo Shrimp tenderly wrapped in Prosciutto di Parma and served with Candied Cherry Tomato Soup & salad: Fritto di Calamari con Salse a Scelta - Lightly Breaded Baby Calamari served with Spicy Marinara or Aioli Sauce Entrée: Filetto di Manzo alla Fiorentina con Crosta al Gorgonzola - Filet Mignon in Gorgonzola Crust with Sautéed Garlic Spinach, Grilled Polenta and Brunello Red Wine Sauce Dessert: Tiramisú - Classic Italian Favorite of Mascarpone Cream, Lady Fingers Soaked in Espresso, Amaretto and Aged Brandy\nBecky liked all of her selections except the Calamari, which she thought was kind of rubbery. Also the Filet Mignon was too much for her to eat, so I had about one third of it. She rated her dinner a 7 out of 10 forks.\nMy selections for dinner were … Appetizer: Mozzarella di Bufala Caprese - Tower of Fresh Bufala Mozzarella and Vine-Ripened Tomatoes with Basil and Extra Virgin Olive Oil Emulsion Soup & salad: Zuppa Di Fagiolie Salciccia - white beans, sweet sausage, pasta Entrée: Branzino Del Mediterraneo - Mediterranean sea bass, fennel-saffron, piedmont hazelnuts, capers, lemon confit Dessert: Toscana Quintet - A selection of five bite size traditional desserts Tortino Di Cioccolata Fondente – molten dark chocolate cake, Sicilian blood orange sauce Tiramisu – red berries tiramisu Crostatina Di Albicocche – crispy apricot tart, pistachio cream Biscotto Di Mandorle e pesche – almond biscuit, roasted peaches, amaretto zabaglione Cappuccino alla crema di castagne – chestnut cream cappuccino, meringue, white chocolate foam\nI liked all my selections. The soup was very good, the best Zuppa Di Fagiolie I’ve ever had. Maybe next time, I’ll just order soup to have with the bread. The Mediterranean sea bass was good, but not spectacular. By the time dessert was served, I was full and only took one bite from each of the five items. The custard in the center cup with the raspberry was good. The only thing that wasn’t that good was the whipped cream thing on the lower right. I gave my dinner 8 out of 10 forks, the soup was the highlight of the meal.\nWe both ordered cappuccinos to have with dessert."

Our morning routine was a repeat of previous mornings – coffee, breakfast, mini-golf, bean bag etc.\nToday was the art scavenger hunt reveal and we each got 20 ‘O’ points for completing the challenge. In the afternoon the ‘O’ points were redeemed for prizes. We had enough points to each get a nice activewear t-shirt. In the afternoon we ordered club sandwiches from room service for lunch.\nToday we receive our loyalty gifts from Oceania as first time cruisers: pins and luggage tags. The next milestone gift is given at five cruises, which are baseball hats and a messenger bag. Earlier in the week Bill and Laurie shared a table in one of the specialty restaurants with an elderly couple named Elizabeth and Thomas. Thomas was in a wheelchair that night and Laurie helped Thomas and Elizabeth get back to their room. Anyway, this morning at breakfast, Elizabeth and Thomas (using a cane) sat at the table next to the four of us and they were wearing their new baseball hats. They said they didn’t want the messenger bag and that Becky could have it. So later we dropped by their cabin to pick it up. The bag is OK, I might use it when I bring my laptop to the coffee shop.\nWe are now at the Blue level (1 to 4 Oceania cruises).\nBecky’s entrée for dinner was a lobster dish and I had Beef Wellington. I ordered it medium, but it came out a bit too rare for me, so I just ate around the edges."

    "text": "Oceania Regatta – day 7\nToday was the final full day of the cruise. Today’s port is Ensenada, Mexico; we didn’t get off the ship. Our morning routine was a repeat of previous mornings – coffee, breakfast, mini-golf, bean bag etc. Except that no ‘O’ points were given out. The same crowd of passengers showed up.\nBecky and I went to the spa, the main pool and had lunch at Waves. Bill and Laurie showed up at Waves around 1pm and sat with us while they ate a late lunch. They had been on a shore excursion. Back at our cabin, Becky watched a movie and I took a nap on the veranda. We also started packing.\nIn the afternoon we attended a musical performed by the cruise director. The music was a set of Broadway songs and narration that told the story of his life. He has a nice voice and before working on cruise ships attended college as a theater major and performed in plays and musicals.\nFor dinner we ordered room service. Passengers with butlers can order course by course in suite dining. So in the afternoon, we informed our butler, Richard, that we would be dining in our suite and we left him a note that contained our selections. We ordered food from Toscona’s. Toscona’s is one of restaurants that we tried to secure an additional reservation for on the first day, but was not allowed since the cruise line needed to allow all the passengers an opportunity to dine at the specialty restaurants at least once on the voyage; which is fair. So instead, we planned to take advantage of the in suite dining.\nFirst course was the appetizer and salad items. We drank the remaining wine from our carry-on wine and a bread basket was also delivered, but without olive oil and balsamic vinegar for dipping. The three plates are: Sliced Eggplant rolled and sautéed with Roasted Minced Veal Stuffing and Basil, baked in Fresh Tomato Sauce, Sautéed Jumbo Shrimp wrapped in Prosciutto and a salad. After about 30 minutes, Richard returned to remove the dishes and serve the next course.\nRichard deboned the Dover Sole. The Dover Sole was recommended online as one of the items not to miss.\nThe second course was the entrees. We ordered: Dover Sole sautéed in Lemon, Parsley and Butter with Steamed Potatoes, Lasagne made with fresh handmade pasta layered with Béchamel Sauce, grated Parmigiano Reggiano and minced Beef Tenderloin with garlic and fresh herbs, and a trio of Gnocchi (potato dumplings in a pesto sauce), Fettuccine and Risotto.\nBecky and I shared the entrees. The Dover Sole and the Lasagne were excellent. On a previous cruise, I had Dover Sole in Le Bistro, the French restaurant on NCL. NCL has an up-charge for the Dover Sole. When we were given a free meal at Le Bistro, I ordered the Sole. I was not impressed; it was bland and mushy. The Dover Sole from Toscona’s was light, flaky and had a light brown crust from the pan searing. The Lasagne was meaty and very tasty. After about 30 minutes, Richard returned to remove the plates. We didn’t order anything for dessert.\nAfter dinner, we finished packing our large suitcase and set it out in the hallway."

We had Silver #3 luggage tags, so we waited until Silver #2 was called before leaving our room. Down in the casino and Martini’s Bar, guests were waiting for their group to be called. I figured it was about time for our group to be called, so we headed for the door. There was no line, we showed our key card for the final time and walked down the gangway. Inside the terminal, I found our bag with the Silver #3 group, but it took a bit of searching. Re-entry to the USA was done by facial recognition, no lines and very quick. Exit from the terminal was on the far end of the building from where we originally arrived, so next time, I’ll park my car on that side of the parking lot.\nBy 9am we were in the car, driving home. Along the way, Google was suggesting alternate routes to avoid slow downs and traffic head. I took the first suggestion, exited the freeway, drove along some neighborhood streets and then was routed to an on ramp which was closed. After passing the closed on ramp, Google routed me to the next on ramp and I decided to just stay on the freeway and ignore future suggested deviations. The car pool lane was flowing at a good rate, which I don’t think Google was taking into consideration. After two hours of driving across LA, we made it home.\nBreakfast: Omelets with bacon and hash browns, yogurt, bagel, danish, OJ and grilled lamb chops."

    "section": "Final thoughts",
    "text": "Final thoughts\nThe Regatta is the smallest cruise ship we have been on. The only other small cruise ship we have experienced was our first cruise back in 1992, on NCL’s Southward, a 802 passenger vessel, built in 1971. The Regatta can carry 670 passengers and has a crew of 386. This gives a passenger to crew ratio of 1.7, which is below 2 and is one of the parameters that define a luxury cruise. Another parameter is the passenger to space ratio, which is calculated by dividing the ship’s gross tonnage by the number of passengers; for the Regatta, this number is 45.2. A number above 50 would indicate that the ship is spacious relative to the passenger load. At 45.2, this number is only slightly higher than large cruise ships like NCL’s Bliss which comes in at 42 or the world’s largest cruise ship, the Wonder of the Seas (Royal Caribbean) which has a passenger to space ratio of 41.3.\nBased on my research, I think the main differences between the standard, deluxe and ultra-luxury cruise lines are, besides the price, are the passenger to crew ratio and the passenger to space ratio. The ultra-luxury cruise lines, such as Regent, Silversea and Seabourn, have passenger to crew ratios closer to one to one, and passenger to space ratios above 50 and sometimes closer to 70. The ultra-luxury cruise lines also tend to be all-inclusive with drinks, shore excursions and gratuities included in the fare.\nOceania Cruises operates seven small cruise ships and Oceania markets itself as having “The Finest Cuisine at Sea”. The other way Oceania describes their ships is - the ultimate small ship experience for travel adventures. Oceania fits into the deluxe or luxury cruise line niche and competes with brands such as Viking Ocean Cruises or Azamara Cruises that operate small to midsize ships. These brands claim to offer finer amenities and a more upscale environment to accompany their elevated prices.\nThe food on the Regatta was good. The service was good. The entertainment was good. I disembarked a satisfied customer. The thing about being on a small ship is that there are fewer bars, fewer restaurants, less entertainment, a smaller experience and a smaller daily program. There was limited availability for restaurant reservations for those guests with a low priority. The buffet was crowded for the first hour after opening. What was offered was high quality food, large expansive menus, sophisticated dishes and no menu up charges. The ship had the vibe of an exclusive country club. All the guests were well behaved, had good manners and knew how to queue for events.\nThe passengers were for the most part older than 60 and usually traveling as couples. I only saw one person who I thought was traveling solo. I didn’t see any children on this voyage and 30 somethings appeared to be traveling with their parents.\nThe free WiFi was slow and only good for email and checking the news or weather. Bill had purchased the WiFi upgrade and he said it worked well for his video conferences. Becky and I shared the WiFi and it was easy to knock the other off line when needed."

    "text": "Thursday: Travel day – flying to Miami\nBecky and I flew to Miami to catch a seven day Caribbean cruise on the Norwegian Joy. The cruise is a round trip from Miami, and we will stop at four ports: Roatán in Honduras, Harvest Caye (NCL’s private island) in Belize, Costa Maya in Mexico and Cozumel in Mexico. Along the way we will have two sea days.\nOur trip started with an early morning drive to Van Nuys to catch the Flyaway bus to LAX to catch a 6:15am departure to Miami on American Airlines.\nWe got up at 1am and left the house at 2:10am. There was no traffic along the way, but there was a bit of fog. We made it to the bus terminal by 3am and by 3:30am we were on the bus headed to LAX. By 4:30am we had our bags checked, made it through security and sat at the gate for about one hour until boarding.\nOur flight to Miami lasted about 5 hours. We departed at sunrise and flew east over Los Angeles and Arizona. At some point there were too many clouds below us to see the land.\nWe were served pre-takeoff beverages, I had a coffee with Baileys and Becky had orange juice with vodka. We were served omelets for breakfast. I started the second chapter of “How the Irish Saved Civilization”, which I’m finding very interesting.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were served pre-takeoff drinks, a small cup of coffee and a screwdriver. We could hear the other passengers ordering champagne, coffee and beer. As we pulled away from the gate, the flight attendant came by to collect the cups and told those who had not finished their drinks to hold them in their hands during take off.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSwiss cheese omelet, Italian chicken sausage, seasoned potatoes, fresh fruit and yogurt.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter collecting our bags, which took about 30 minutes, we went outside to the hotel shuttle pick-up spot. The temperature outside was in the low 70’s. When we got on the van there were two guys sitting in the front of the van, which seemed a bit unusual when I thought about it later. We were waiting at door number three, so I told Becky that we still have to pick up at the other terminals so the van might get crowded. We made it almost to the last terminal before stopping where the two guys got out. So Becky and I moved up to the first row in the van, since a big group of people were getting on. That way she could get off the bus first and get us checked in, or so we thought. It took a while to get everyone’s bags loaded and for them to all get aboard. Then the two guys who had been in the van when we boarded got back on.\nI said to one of them, ‘sorry, we took your seats, I didn’t know you were coming back.’\nHe said, ‘no worries, we had to return a bag and thought we would be catching the next van’. Then he proceeded to explain that he had picked up someone else’s bag and got a call from the airline asking if they had the wrong bag, which they did, and that’s why they were back at the airport.\nAt the hotel, the desk clerk would not let Becky check us in since the reservation was in my name. Becky said, “But he’s right outside collecting our bags.”\n“I need to see him face to face”, was his answer.\nBy then, the large group was lining up behind Becky when I showed up and we proceeded with the check-in. The leader of the large group, and we could tell they all knew each other by the conversations in the van, was informed that he was at the wrong hotel. We never asked the driver which address he was going to and just assumed we were going to ‘our’ hotel. Lucky for us, we were in the right van. Becky had gotten the instructions and was told to just get on the red Town Place hotel van, like there would only be theirs that pick up at the Miami airport.\nDinner was Cuban sandwiches from a nearby Cuban restaurant, which was about a five minute walk. They were good but a little too much bread and meat."

    "text": "Friday: Miami, pre-cruise stay\nOur pre cruise hotel was the TownePlace Suites by Marriott, about one mile from the Miami Airport terminal. We flew into Miami two days prior to our cruise to ensure that we would make it to Miami for our cruise. Flying in two days early means that we probably could make the cruise even if we experienced a big delay or missed our flight. On the other hand it means that we have a full day in Miami without much to do.\nThe hotel has a complimentary breakfast each morning. Breakfast consisted of scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage biscuit, oatmeal, cheese, yogurt, muffin and coffee. Overall the free breakfast was adequate but mediocre. I took two yogurts to eat later. The only complaint about the hotel is the low flow shower head, it’s really low flow.\nThe weather today was clear and calm in the morning, but in the afternoon it was partly cloudy and windy.\nThere was a Target store and shopping center located about a 15 minute walk away. The Target store looked brand new. It was the biggest and nicest Target store I’ve ever seen. Becky bought some wool winter socks. Why do people in Miami need wool socks? Who knows. We visited a Walgreens, a liquor store, a store called Government Discount, which reminded me of a Big Lots, but it was bigger. We also took a look at a grocery store called Fresco y Mas.\nOn our walk back to the hotel we bought burritos at a place Becky found on-line called Taqueria Los Potrillos. We bought chicken burritos which were very good. In fact, we both thought they were much better than the Cuban sandwiches we had yesterday.\n\n\n\nOur hotel room was a good place to watch the planes landing at the Airport. In the morning around 9am, a new plane would land every 2 minutes. Later it was less frequent and in the afternoon, it was every 10 minutes or so."

    "text": "Saturday: Embark NCL Joy\nI was up early since I couldn’t sleep. I took an early shower and made a cup of coffee and it rained overnight, the forecast calls for clearing weather later in the day.\nWe had a light breakfast at the hotel. Breakfast room was more crowded than the day before and there were lines for the food, coffee and waffle maker. We had some coffee and a ham and egg breakfast sandwich. We were done in about 10 minutes. We didn’t need to fill up since we would be getting food on the ship. Back in the room we finished packing up and decided to schedule a Lyft pickup for 9:40am. Our port check-in time that was assigned 21 days ago was for 9:30am to 10am and the drive from the hotel was only 20 minutes. The Lyft driver arrived about 20 minutes early. We could see his car from our 6th floor window and then I got a text from him saying he had arrived. So I answered back and we went downstairs to check out of the hotel and get our bags loaded in his car.\nHe asked us, ‘Is music Okay?’ We said yes, and he put on some Cuban Salsa music. He was a very aggressive driver and liked to change lanes a lot and got honked at several times.\nAt the terminal we dropped our check on bags with a porter and proceeded into the terminal. NCL’s terminal was finished just as COVID started and sat unused for much of the pandemic. The terminal is a nice big terminal with very high ceilings and big glass walls that are about six stories high. We have been in the terminal for two other cruises. The acoustics in the terminal are poor and it’s hard to make out what the announcements are saying. The volume is loud enough, but there’s so much other noise in the room. Also the bathrooms are in short supply, as well as seating when the terminal gets full. Lots of passengers end up either sitting on the floor or standing around.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCL Terminal, main hall\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNCL Terminal, security\n\n\n\n\n\nOn this cruise we are staying in a suite, so we got to wait in the VIP section, which has a special check in area, with a separate elevator and security checkpoint.\nI tried to sneak two mini bottles of Baileys Irish cream (that we got from the airline) through the security checkpoint, but got caught. The bottles were confiscated and I’ll need to pick them up at the end of the cruise at the terminal’s guest services office. The security guard saw the bottles in my pockets and asked me to empty my pockets and put the contents in the tray for x-ray. I was given the option to pay $15 per bottle corkage fee. I wanted to sneak the bottles on to avoid having to pick them up later, so my plan failed. I should have just left the bottles loose in my carry-on suitcase, because I don’t think they are checking that close.\nThe VIP section of the terminal is elevated above the main waiting floor and from there we can see all the security operations and waiting area for regular passengers. On a previous cruise we could somewhat see the VIP guests if they were standing at the rail. Since it was our first time up in the VIP section we were taking lots of pictures. At some point, security came up to Becky and told her no photography is allowed. He said, ’you need to delete all those pictures you took.’ And he waited while Becky moved the photos to the trash can, then showed the security guy and he left. We don’t remember seeing any signs, but I guess it’s like airport TSA where no photos are allowed. Did he really think the photos were permanently deleted or was that just for show? Later, we saw other guests taking photos of the same areas, but the terminal was much more crowded by then and maybe security had other things to do besides keeping an eye out for people taking pictures. We each got busted for something, not a good start.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIP waiting area\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIP coffee\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVIP snacks\n\n\n\n\n\nBoarding didn’t start until about two hours after we arrived, sitting in the VIP waiting area with coffee and snacks was nice. I had a cup of coffee and it was the strongest coffee I’ve seen in a long time; I needed to dilute it by 50% with hot water. The only snacks I had were some cookies, which were very good with the coffee.\nGetting on the ship was not that smooth of a process. There were several hundred VIP guests and we were led as a group to the gang way for boarding, but the key card readers stopped working, so we had about a 20 minute wait. Then once on board there was another wait for the elevators to take the suite guests to deck 17, where most of their rooms are located. Becky and I skipped the elevator line and went to our cabin to drop off our carry-on bags. Then we went down to the cruise next desk to sign up for the week’s events.\nOur cabin on this cruise is on deck 12 and is a forward facing penthouse with a side balcony. The cabin (414 square feet in area) has a separate bedroom and living area. The balcony for our cabin was on the small side at 27 square feet in area. Since the cabin is forward facing we have a large porthole window with a view of the front of the ship and the wall on this side of the cabin is sloped.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLiving room view from balcony\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBathroom sinks, toilet and shower\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTub and vanity\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBedroom and forward window\n\n\n\n\n\nPrior to sailing Becky requested room amenities of plain and peanut M&M’s, gummy bears, extra firm pillows, orange juice (for the sparkling wine) and milk for coffee. The only item missing was the extra firm pillow for me, but I didn’t notice it wasn’t delivered until bed time. I never did ask for the extra firm pillow since the regular ones were fine. Our cabin comes with access to the Haven exclusive areas which include the Haven Horizon Lounge, Haven pool, sun deck and the Haven dining room, which serves breakfast, lunch and dinner.\n\n\n\nBy the end of the first day we had received a table full of stuff. Two bowls of M&Ms (peanut and mini), gummy bears, a bottle of Merlot, two bottles of sparkling wine and chocolate covered strawberries.\n\n\nAfter dropping off our bags in our cabin, we went out to explore the ship. The Joy had just come out of dry dock and there were some changes made to the ship since we last cruised on her. The spa received a big upgrade with additional features added like a thermal pool (hot tub), hot sauna and a steam room and a rain shower (kind of hard to describe). To make room for the added spa features, the Galaxy Pavilion was removed; the Galaxy Pavilion was a large virtual reality arcade.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nJoy’s main pool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaven pool\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaven Horizon Lounge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSail away cake in the buffet, served during lunch on embarkation day.\n\n\n\n\n\nLater we had lunch in the Haven dining room. I had a Cobb salad and Becky had the Shrimp scampi and we shared the Seafood Fritto Misto (Fried calamari, shrimp, scallops, onions, zucchini and remoulade sauce). After lunch we went to the buffet, which was very crowded, to look at the special desserts on the first day and we brought some desserts back to the room to have later with coffee. Becky’s check-on bag came first, mine came about 1 hour later.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCobb Salad – grilled chicken breast, bacon, hard boiled egg, romaine, tomatoes, avocado, Roquefort, choice of dressing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShrimp Scampi – angel hair pasta, zucchini, white wine garlic sauce\n\n\n\n\n\nAt 5pm the ship started to leave the dock so we went up to the observation lounge to watch sailaway. The Icon of the seas was docked in front of us and we had a good view of the world’s newest and largest cruise ship – Royal Caribbean Icon of the Seas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of NCL’s terminal shortly after pulling away. The cruise ship on the left side of the photo is an MSC cruise ship and the one on right side of the photo is the Icon of the Seas.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyal Caribbean’s Icon of the Seas\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had dinner in the Haven restaurant. I had lobster deviled eggs, soup and a crab cake. Becky had the Shrimp Louie, beet salad and Surf and turf. She didn’t want all the steak, so I ate some of hers. For dessert we split the chocolate cake and each had a scoop of ice cream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLobster Deviled Eggs – mustard, celery, relish, parmesan crisp\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShrimp Louie – romaine lettuce, avocado, tomato, piccalili, thousand island dressing\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButternut Squash Soup – with duck confit\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSea Salt Roasted Beets – whipped goat cheese, crispy speck, pistachios\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCrab Cakes – pommery mustard sauce, homemade coleslaw\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurf and Turf – lobster tail, filet mignon, sauteed spinach, baked potato, bearnaise sauce. The waiters will remove the lobster meat from the shell, which can be tricky\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOMG Caramel Butterscotch Cheesecake – vanilla custard\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDecadent Chocolate – devil’s fudge cake\n\n\n\n\n\nThe show tonight was called, Beatles Story: Fabulous Tribute Show, history from 1962 to 1966, which was about 20 songs played by four musicians dressed up to look like the Beatles. The show was good and the songs were all their well known hits.\nAfter the show we went to the ship’s gift shops, since they were now open, to look for something to buy with our non-refundable on board credit. We will probably buy a bottle of rum if we can’t find anything else to spend the money on.\nMaking it to the ship on embarkation day is crucial since the opportunity to join the ship at the first port would be very difficult in this itinerary. Missing a cruise ship is not covered completely by my travel insurance. The travel insurance I have will cover trip delay and interruption for up to $500 per day for actual expenses incurred, and not reimbursement for the cost of a cruise if you miss the ship."

    "text": "Sunday: at sea\nThe ship’s location at daybreak was off the coast of western Cuba.\nI got up early, made a cup of coffee and ate the brownie from the buffet we took yesterday. The skies were clear and the air temperature was about 65F.\nWe had breakfast in the Haven dining room. I had Poached Eggs ‘Meurette’ and Becky had an omelet. I’m working my way down the breakfast menu. After breakfast we went down to the lobby where morning trivia takes place. When we got there, a Sudoku challenge was about to start. The guests participating had 15 minutes to solve the puzzle and about 10 were able to do so. The next event was trivia and Becky and I didn’t join any other teams. We got 10 of 20 questions correct and the high score was 15 out of 20.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning coffee and fruit plate\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Haven Horizon lounge there is a small buffet. In the morning starting at 6:30 am, fruit, cheese, cold cuts, breads and danishes are available. At about 11am, the selections are changed to small roll ups, cookies, whole fruits, chips and dessert items.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe coffee machine in the Horizon lounge is very nice. The machine will make Espresso, Café Crème, Cappuccino, Caffè Latte, Espresso Macchiato, Americano, Latte Macchiato. I usually make an Americano with cream and Becky makes a Cappuccino, to which she adds Baileys Irish Cream. I’ve tried the Latte, but it’s too milky for me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPoached Eggs ‘Meurette’ – grilled country bread, bacon, mushrooms, Bordelaise sauce\n\n\n\n\n\nOvernight, our on-board credit was loaded to our account, so now we could see the exact amount. There were some small charges for tax on drinks served while in the Port of Miami and we had $124 to spend. Since we had time before our next event, we stopped by the gift shops to look around and Becky noticed that they were selling a brand of watches called Swatch, which she likes. She reminded me that I lost a bet a few years ago where I bet her a Swatch that she could not get into the pool because it was so cold; for a Swatch, I found out she could. She found one that she liked for $61 and we used some of the on board credit to make the purchase.\n\n\n\nB- Becky’s new swatch\n\n\nOur first event of the morning was wines around the world wine tasting. This is a free event for Latitude Sapphire and above members. While we were waiting, the Assistant Hotel Director walked by and I said, ‘Hey Trevor’, to get his attention. We know Trevor from previous cruises and from other ships. One of the other guests who was standing nearby asked if we were the other Ambassadors and we said yes; she was also an Ambassador and her name was Lydia. During the wine tasting event, Becky and Lydia talked a lot. Wine tasting on the Joy was conducted differently than other ships, here it was more like a class and less socializing. At the wine event I met Dan who was traveling solo.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLatitude Wines Around the World, available to Latitude Platinum members and above. Usually four reds and four white wines are available and the countries or regions are the US, South America (Argentina and Peru) and France. On the Joy, the servers bring the wines to you and give you small pours. On other ships, like the Bliss, the guests go from station to station and can drink as much as they want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSail & Sustain Mixology Experience – Eight shots of various sweet concoctions are poured while the mixologist explains what they are. I really only like two of them. We usually skip this event, which is available to Latitude Diamond members and above. The reason we usually skip the event is that it’s held at one of the outside bars, which can be windy or hot; and the time of the event often interferes with other activities.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe had lunch in our room, which was BLT sandwiches from room service. We also stopped by the Haven lounge and took two plates of various food back to our room.\nAt 1pm we attended the Latitudes party. A table was reserved for the Ambassadors, which was nice. Dan also joined us at our table. The Latitude party is more or less a short sales presentation for what Norwegian calls their Cruise Next Program, where you can put a deposit down on a future cruise and receive cash back in the form of non-refundable credit.\nAt 2pm we attended the Mixology event, which is free for Latitude Diamond members and above. This was held outside at the Mojito Bar. The weather was sunny and not too windy or hot. We sometimes skip this event since we don’t care for the drinks served at the event. Lydia, Becky and I were the only ones who attended.\nAround 5pm the captain made an announcement about stopping for a fishing vessel that looked like a small raft. The occupants said that they were just fishermen and didn’t need assistance.\nAt 6pm we attended the Captain’s VIP party, which we always attend. Sometimes the party is very crowded, but this evening not so much. The drinks and Horderves are usually very good. Lydia was also at the party. Suite guests and Latitude Ambassadors are invited to the Captains VIP party. Lydia is staying in a regular balcony cabin, but she is a brand new Ambassador.\nAfter the party we had dinner in the Haven restaurant. I had the Pan Seared Steelhead Trout, not so good this time – under cooked in the middle, and Becky had one crab cake and a lobster tail. Becky didn’t like her crab cake and gave it to me.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSlow Roasted Pork Belly - Sweet Potato, Granny Smith Apple, Piquillo Pepper Coulis\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPan Seared Steelhead Trout – beluga lentils, sauteed broccolini, vierge sauce.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky’s dinner - one crab cake and one lobster tail"

Breakfast was avocado toast for me and Becky had french toast.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky’s breakfast - French toast with ham on the side\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAvocado Toast – poached egg, feta, multi grain bread\n\n\n\n\n\nThe ship docked at Roatán, Honduras around 9am. As we left the ship it was lightly raining, but not enough to make us put up our umbrellas. There is ongoing construction at the port area and we wanted to see what was new. That took about 15 minutes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBuilding murals in the Port of Roatan\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA view of the Joy from shore side. In the background, a Viking Ocean cruise ship was also in port.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Port of Roatan from Haven sun deck.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spent the remainder of the morning at the sun deck, then went to swim in the pool, but it was very cold and I could only stay in for a minute.\nLunch was in the Haven restaurant and we had the fish sandwich with no bun. The fish seemed a bit undercooked, so I just ate around the edges. Becky also had a Ceasar Salad and we ordered the mushroom flatbread to share.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSesame Crusted Fish Sandwich – pickled ginger slaw, wasabi mayonnaise, golden french fries w/o the bun.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCaesar Salad - Romaine Lettuce, Parmesan Cheese, Garlic Croutons, Anchovies, Caesar Dressing. Available with, Grilled Salmon, Chicken Breast or Shrimp.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMushroom Flatbread - Shiitake, Beech, Porcini, Button, Fontina Cheese Sauce, Micro Basil\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon we played a game called word worm. You are given a category and a letter. Then you think of a matching word, the next word then needs to start with the last letter of the first word and also match the category. You get one point for every word.\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon, our butler delivered a plate of Cruditees - Raw and Marinated Vegetables, Creamy Dipping Sauce.\n\n\nOur dinner tonight was at the French restaurant called Le Bistro. I had Coq au Vin and Becky had the Lamb chops.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCoq Au Vin - Red Wine-Braised Chicken, Mushrooms, Potatoes, Pearl Onion, Bacon\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky’s dinner: Carré d’Agneau Rôti et Souris d’Agneau aux Saveurs Marocaines - Braised Shank and Roasted Lamb Chop, Moroccan Spices, Dried Fruits, Sweet Potatoes, Cilantro\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter dinner we went to the comedy show, which was so-so. The show was PG-13 and mainly parity songs with some bathroom humor.\nFor our night cap, I had a brandy on the rocks and Becky had a Carajillo, which is an espresso liquor; she didn’t like it too much."

    "text": "Tuesday: Harvest Caye, Belize\n\n\n\nSun rise on the way to Belize\n\n\nToday’s port was Harvest Caye in Belize, which is NCL’s “private island”. I woke early, made coffee and did some work on my laptop. We ordered room service breakfast for delivery at 7am. By 8am the ship had been cleared and we went ashore. The skies were partly cloudy and the temperature was about 80F. On the island, there are shops, restaurants, bars and a small zoo called the Wildlife Experience. The most interesting thing in the Wildlife Experience is the butterfly cage. There were two types of butterflies, one with blue wings and another called the Owl Face (or something like that).\n\n\n\nHarvest Caye from Haven sun deck\n\n\nThere is a very nice pool on the island and we spent about two hours lazing on the lounge chairs by the pool. When we arrived, not too many people were there and we had our pick of lounge chairs and umbrellas in the shade. The water felt cold and when the sun went behind a cloud it was a little chilly. The food and drink on the island is not included in the cruise fare.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCats and carvings for sale\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe LightHouse, which is the launching point for the zip line.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe pool on Harvest Caye\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChairs lined up on the beach. The Lounges in the back row with the yellow sun tops (folded back) are for rent.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe path through the butterfly cage.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOwl butterflies\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nButterfly Pupae\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBlue butterfly, this one had a section of his wing missing and was not too active.\n\n\n\n\n\nA bit before noon, we walked back to the ship and went for a swim in the Haven pool. We sat on the pool mezzanine, ordered lunch and drank a beer. Before going back to the room, we ordered a carrot cake from the lunch menu to be our dessert for dinner. If you let the restaurant know before lunch service ends, most items on the lunch menu can be served for dinner.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaven pool with roof open\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHaven sun deck, an exclusive area for Haven guests and much less crowded than the main pool deck.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIce Cream Sandwiches – sable cookies with vanilla and chocolate, shredded coconut, red velvet crumbs. As you can see, the ice cream is starting to melt and these were hard to eat, since the ice cream squished out when you took a bite of the sandwich\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nChicken Caesar Wrap – chicken breast, romaine, tomato herb tortilla, onion rings and french fries.\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were back in our room by 2pm, just in time for some chocolates to be delivered. So we had a piece of chocolate and a cup of coffee. Later I took a nap and at about 4pm the butler delivered cookies and cruditees.\nBefore dinner we had cocktails. Dinner tonight was at the Haven restaurant and I ordered Surf and Turf and Becky ordered Lamb. I gave my lobster to Becky. The lobsters on this cruise are bigger and tastier than on previous cruises, according to Becky. Now they charge $25 for a second lobster. Before you could get at many as you wanted. I’m not a lobster fan, so Becky could have two tails, mine and hers, but so far one is enough.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSomeone ordered a smoked old fashioned and the bartender is giving the drink the smoke treatment.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSurf and Turf\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPancetta Wrapped Lamb Ribeye - Roasted Potatoes, Green Beans, Rosemary Jus\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCarrot Cake\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter dinner we went to listen to music performed by one of the bands, called ADDA. They were singing mellow country hits, like songs from the Eagles and John Denver. They were very good. We didn’t stay too long since we wanted to watch the show in the main theater; tonight’s show was the Beatles Story – Sgt. Pepper’s. We like some of the Beatles’ music, but not so much from this era. The theater was very full and we sat in the VIP area, something we don’t normally do, since there is a different row that we like better since it has better visibility. During the show, there was a Code Alpha announcement and the band stopped playing for a few minutes. Code Alpha is for a medical emergency somewhere on the ship.\n\n\n\nNCL’s house band performing in the Q SmokeHouse Restaurant.\n\n\nTonight we had to turn the clock forward one hour."

Next on my breakfast line up was the Eggs Benedict. The Joy was the first ship to dock. There was a Carnival and a Royal Caribbean ship also docking at Costa Maya. The winds were strong and there was a large swell at the dock and we could see the water splashing onto the dock sometimes. A few minutes after tying up, the Captain announced that it was not safe to remain at dock and that we would be leaving. We pulled away a few minutes later. Since we missed the port we were refunded $20 in port taxes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPassengers purchase rubber ducks, attach tags and hide them in spots around the cruise ship. When we find a duck, we take them home and add them to our small collection of cruise ducks. These are the ones we found so far. Usually we only find one, but the “cruise duck” thing has become very popular and now there are more to find.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOn this afternoon the main pool was very crowded.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTraditional Eggs Benedict - Poached Eggs, Canadian Bacon, Toasted English Muffin, Hollandaise, Country Potatoes\n\n\n\n\n\nWe spent the morning by the pool doing some reading.

    "text": "Thursday: Cozumel, Mexico\nWe had early coffee in the Horizon lounge with some fruit and danishes. For breakfast I had the Shrimp Toast and Becky had the egg white frittata.\nThe ship was cleared and most of the passengers went ashore. There were only a few people playing morning trivia, we got 13 out of 20 and tied for first place. Apparently all the smart people had gone ashore and only the dumb ones were still around to play trivia.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMorning fruit and coffee.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nShrimp Toast – basted egg, avocado, cilantro, kimchi aioli\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky’s breakfast – one pancake, sausage and potatoes\n\n\n\n\n\nWe were docked next to Radiance of the Seas, a smaller and older ship. We spent the morning by the pool. Later we had lunch on the outdoor patio. The skies were partly cloudy and the air temperature was about 70F, just perfect for having lunch outdoors. I had a Cobb Salad and Becky had the fish sandwich with no bun. I had some of her fish. The piece of fish is too big for a sandwich. For dessert we had a brownie and ice cream.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nToday’s lunch on the outside patio. Previous days were either too hot or too windy or both to have a meal outside.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRoyal Caribbean’s Radiance of the Seas sharing the pier with us.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSeafood Fritto Misto - customized with items Becky wanted, shrimp, scallops and zucchini\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCobb salad\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSesame Crusted Fish Sandwich – pickled ginger slaw, wasabi mayonnaise, golden french fries, served with out the the bun\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDark Chocolate Walnut Brownie – salted caramel, candied carrot chips. This dessert was more like a piece of fudge than a traditional brownie.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOur butler gave us one of his paintings.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfternoon snacks delivered by our butler: a cheese plate, chocolates and cruditiees\n\n\nAfter lunch we started to watch a movie. I only lasted about 10 minutes before going off to the bedroom to take a nap. Dinner tonight was at the Italian restaurant called La Cucina and was complimentary from the Hotel Manager and dinner came with a bottle of wine. I selected a white wine from Spain (Antonio Nadal Ari Goitia Verdejo “the Flyer”, Rueda, Spain). I think it was a white blend and the waiter helped me pick it out. I had the Pollo Cacciatore (chicken simmered in fresh tomatoes, rosemary garlic sauce, peppers and onions) and Becky had the Gamberi Fra Diavolo, basically a shrimp dish which she customized by adding extra shrimp, changing the sauce to one less spicy and holding the pasta; so essentially a plate of shrimp with some spaghetti sauce. For dessert Becky had the Tiramisu and I had the cheesecake. Lydia joined us for dinner. She had the salmon (grilled salmon, white beans, crispy cured ham).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTorta di Ricotta con Crema al Limone – ricotta cheesecake, lemon curd, milk chocolate sauce\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTiramisu – Lady fingers, espresso, mascarpone cream\n\n\n\n\n\nWe learned that Lydia has ducks and has been hiding them around the ship. Later that evening she left us one of her ducks at our door, so now we have four ducks to take home."

    "text": "Friday: at sea\nI woke up at 5am to make a cup of coffee and work on my laptop. Later we went to Horizon Lounge to have some coffee and fruit. Becky had a danish and cappuccino. The hotel director, Rohinton, was making his morning rounds and we talked to him for a bit and said our goodbyes. Breakfast was in the Haven restaurant and we both had omelets.\n\n\n\nMy pre-breakfast of tropical fruits and a cup of Americano coffee with cream. Becky had an almond pastry, cappuccino with Baileys\n\n\nWe went to morning trivia and got 8 out of 20 while drinking French 75’s. I collected the $15 in refundable credit then we picked up our liquor purchase, which was a bottle of Rye. Back at the room Becky did some packing before lunch.\n\n\n\nA view of the atrium where cruise staff led activities are held. This is where trivia is held.\n\n\nBefore lunch we had drinks at the Haven bar, Becky had a Hibiscus Martini and I had bourbon on the rocks. Chatted with some lady from Vermont, who was on her first cruise. For lunch Becky had Lobster bisque, Shrimp linguine with extra shrimp and ice cream for dessert. I had a mushroom flatbread for a starter, a Brie Burger and for dessert I also had ice cream.\nAfter lunch we went to the Horizon lounge for coffee and some snacks. Then we went for a walk around the ship. At the lobby bar we ran into Dan and later Lydia. We stayed and chatted with them for a couple hours while having a drink. We learned that Dan is a Radiologist from Ohio who likes cruising and that he lost his wife to cancer a few years ago. His kids don’t like him to cruise, visit the casino or drink beers all day long.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky’s drink being made – Hibiscus Martini\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe finished drink.\n\n\n\n\n\nDinner was in the Haven restaurant. Becky had roasted beets for a starter and surf and turf. She had to request a replacement lobster since the first one was mushy and maybe undercooked. I had butternut squash soup and double cut pork chops, which were good.\n\n\n\nDouble Cut Pork Chop – Braised red cabbage, Pomme Puree, Pommery mustard sauce\n\n\nAfter dinner, Becky had a chocolate martini, which was on her list of drinks to try and I had a glass of port. Back at the room we did more packing before going to bed."

    "text": "Saturday: disembark\nThe ship arrived in Miami very early and we were alongside the pier by 530am. After showering, we did our final packing and headed up to deck 17 for our final meal on the ship. We both had omelets for breakfast. We skipped the coffee since we would be in exit lines and might not find restrooms until we got to the airport.\nAround 8am we left our room for the final time with all our bags and took the elevator to deck 17 where the Haven lounge is located. Patrick, the concierge, said the three bedroom suite had been vacated so we went up to have a look at the room. The room hadn’t been cleaned yet, and the beds were not made, but it was interesting to see the rooms. It had a dining table for six, a big living room and a very large balcony.\nFrom the Haven lobby, we took a service elevator to deck 7 where we exited the ship. I asked where the confiscated liquor pickup was and I was told that it was back on the ship, which was not what I was told when they took the mini bottles from me.\nCustoms and Border Protection was quick and it’s done with facial recognition. Out on the street I had a hard time getting a cell connection and I switched my mobile connection to LTE from 5G, which seemed to work better. I was able to connect to Lyft and call for a ride. Our Lyft ride arrived in about 5 minutes, a Chevy Silverado pickup truck. It had a crew cab and our luggage fit in the bed of the truck. Our driver didn’t speak any English, but with my limited Spanish and his limited English, we learned that he was from Cuba and arrived in the US two years ago.\nOnce we left the cruise terminal area the traffic was light and we arrived at the airport in no time. We were able to check our bags and go through security. Talked to a Turkish lounge representative who offered us a ride, but we said no, since it was still early and there is a three hour maximum time limit in the lounge. The Turkish lounge is part of the Priority Pass program, which many travel credit cards like American Express Platinum, Capital One Venture X and Chase Sapphire Reserve include as a benefit. “Free” access is nice, but the venues always seem crowded.\nWe waited until about 1030am to check into the lounge. The Turkish Airlines Lounge had gotten good reviews, but when we got there it was extremely crowded and we could not find a seat. After looking around for a few minutes we saw empty seats in the small computer room, so we sat there. At least I can plug in my laptop (while I write this). I had a cup of coffee and later a small sandwich and a beer. Becky had some cookies, coffee and a small chicken sandwich with a glass of wine. There was a waiting line for the bathroom and limited selection of food. Beer, sodas and wine were available in the morning and in the afternoon a self service bar was set up. Overall, probably the worst airport lounge experience because of the crowds and the mediocre food. Good thing it’s kind of free. Not worth the long walk if you are short on time.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe entrance to the Turkish Airlines Lounge\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA small food counter with limited selections: Two kinds of soup, but one was empty; Small sandwiches; cookies etc. Food was available from an online menu and I saw orders of meatballs and humus being delivered.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe drink counter was small and the coffee machine only served half cups of coffee. Soda, water and two types of beer were in the refrigerators.\n\n\n\n\n\nAfter leaving the Turkish Lounge (at 1:48pm), we did some walking around the airport. We still had 5 hours to wait until boarding.\nAt 330pm we had tacos with rice and beans at the Corona Beach House, also a Priority Pass venue. While we were eating the airline announced a gate change, from D10 to D42. The tacos were good and since we didn’t spend the full $60 allowance, there was no bill at the end. This surprised me, since normally there are taxes that are required to be paid; so all we did was leave a tip.\nIt must be spring break time since the airport is full of groups of kids.\nWhen we got tired of sitting we went on walks around the terminal. Terminal D in Miami must be about a mile long and there are 60 gates on the D concourse.\nThe flight from Miami to Los Angeles was 5 hours long. Becky pre-ordered meals for us. I had the chicken breast and Becky had roast beef. Dessert was an ice cream Sundae.\nTwo passengers in first class didn’t make the flight and two coach passengers from the back were moved up to first class, one of them was a pilot.\nWhen we landed it was overcast and there were some showers. Bags from a Maui flight came down the ramp wet. Our bags were only slightly damp. We had a 20 minute wait for the Flyaway bus. The traffic was light for the trip to Van Nuys. After paying for parking, $60, we rolled our bags up to the second level of the parking garage and loaded the car. We were home by 1am, local time. For us we had been up almost 24 hours. From the time the wheels of the plane touched down at LAX to when we arrived home, it took three hours.\nThe trip was nice, but we ate too much. Three big meals in addition to the butler snacks and afternoon snacks, horizon lounge snacks was too much. I wasn’t hungry for dinner sometimes."

Today we are embarking on the Oceania Regatta for a seven day cruise with stops in Santa Barbara, San Francisco and Ensenada Mexico. We are back to our routine of going somewhere about every month.\nIt was a year ago when we cruised on the Regatta. The itinerary is similar; this time with a stop in Santa Barbara in place of Catalina Island. Oceania advertises itself as having the “Finest Cuisine at Sea”. We thought the food was good on Oceania, but not really the finest; food is very subjective. Holland and NCL have good food and Oceania was not head and shoulders above them. I suppose what makes Oceania unique is that there is no up-charge for any of the food items. For example, the coffee shop on the Regatta, called Baristas, which serves specialty coffees, teas, pastries and finger foods, are all included in the cruise fare. Oceania offers grilled Lobster tail, grilled Lamb chops and Gelato in the buffet with no additional charge. I think my trip reports will be primarily about food and the daily activities. As far as the food goes, on this cruise, I’m planning to try different menu items from those I had last time on the Regatta.\nSince our last cruise on Oceania, there is a new program called, “Simply More”, where a shore excursion credit and wine and beer, served by the glass, during lunch and dinner are included in the cruise fare. There is no opting out, so we are being forced to take shore excursions and drink wine or beer. Such a hardship! I’m not complaining about the wine and beer, but the included shore excursions are not that great. More on that later in the week when we take the excursions that Becky and I selected.\nThis cruise is advertised as, “West Coast Vines - Round Trip Los Angeles”. The cruise line offers some wine related excursions in Santa Barbara and Ensenada. We scheduled an excursion in Ensenada to a winery that also includes lunch.\n\n\n\nAbout a month before embarkation, we received four luggage tags and a cruise itinerary book from Oceania. A year ago, the book was personalized with our names printed in various places in the book. This year, the book is just a generic printing that describes the itinerary and the amenities offered by Oceania on this cruise.\n\n\nThe luggage tags are nice and can be used for any trip. We received a sheet of printed inserts for the luggage tags with our names and cabin number.\nAs soon as the specialty restaurant reservation window opened, about three months prior to sailing, Becky booked dining at the steak house and Italian restaurant. We wanted early seating and a two top table. We have no interest in sharing a table with strangers. The upper categories of cabins have early booking for restaurant reservations, so we were able to secure the times we wanted. Cabins below the concierge category are the last group to book (about 70% of the ship). Those passengers will be sharing tables and have late dining times. The specialty restaurants are simply too small to accommodate everyone’s preferences.\nThis is our second Oceania cruise, and as repeat Oceania cruisers, we can attend the captain’s party, a second chance to order free drinks. The beverage package is an additional $50 per person per day and includes most alcoholic beverages, which we did not purchase. We can bring our own wine and spirits on board for consumption in our room, and mixers are free and delivered by the butler, so drinking in the bar is not what we plan to do on this cruise. We have $100 of ship credit, so we might order a few drinks during happy hour. I’m bringing a Nalgene bottle with a 1:1 mix of vodka and gin to make gin and tonics. I like to dilute my gin with some vodka. Becky brings Crown Royal to mix with Sprite along with a bottle of Pinot Grigio. We received a bottle of champagne and a bottle of red wine to enjoy in our room, a bowl of fruit and a vase of fresh flowers.\nThis morning I woke at 6am, made a cup of coffee and started the final packing. Most of my things were already in the suitcase, all that remained were last minute items. Breakfast was a fried egg and half of a chicken sausage. Becky made herself a fried egg sandwich.\nThe drive to the cruise port in San Pedro is 81 miles from Ventura and took about two hours. We ran into lots of typical weekday morning traffic and there was one crash that caused a 15 minute delay. As we passed the crash, there were about ten cars pulled off to the side of the freeway. Only one of the cars was badly damaged. We arrived at the cruise terminal around 1045am. The company that runs the parking lot has installed new gates at the entrance and it took me a minute to figure out how to work them. Now you have to tap your credit card before you can pull a ticket. The parking lot was surprisingly empty and we drove around a bit to find a good parking spot near the luggage drop off. The Crown Princess was also in port.\nAfter dropping off our one checked bag we had to wait about 2 minutes before the attendants started calling for cabins. They called for owners’ suites first, but no one got up, so a minute later the PH category was called and about 20 people got up to get in line for the check in counter. Oceania runs their checkin different than the other cruise lines, there is no unnecessary standing in lines. A few minutes later we had our key cards and were on the ship. The first thing we had to do was check in at our muster station to get our key cards scanned. Then we went to find lunch.\n\n\n\nCruise itinerary map. On this cruise the ports are Santa Barbara, 2 days in San Francisco and Ensenada, Mexico, is the obligatory foreign port."

Becky had read that this is sometimes possible on the first day. The Italian restaurant Toscana had an opening and we got a two topper by the window.\n\n\n\nDinner is served with a bread basket and a clove of roasted garlic. Our waiter came by our table with a cart of olive oils and balsamic vinegars that can be poured into a small bowl for dipping the bread in. Since we didn’t have any clue about the various types of olive oil or balsamic vinegar, we went with his suggestions.\n\n\n\n\n\nOlive oil and balsamic vinegar cart.\n\n\nFirst course: both were good. Becky ordered her shrimp scampi without the pepper flakes.\n\n\n\nCode Di Scampi – sauteed jumbo shrimp, cherry tomato sauce\n\n\n\n\n\nInvoltini Di Melanzane – eggplant rolls, prague ham and smoked scamorza stuffing, tomato sauce, parmesan. These were really good. The egg plant was sliced very thin and fried.\n\n\nSecond course: Becky only wanted the tagliolini carbonara. The other pastas were good. I don’t remember the name of Chef’s Pasta Special, but it was spicy with a hint of bacon.\n\n\n\nTrio Toscana – tagliolini carbonara, risotto allaragosta, gnocchi al pesto\n\n\n\n\n\nChef’s Pasta Special\n\n\nMain course: Both were good, but Becky only ate half of the lobster, so I gave her some of the dover sole and I ate the rest of her lobster. The dover sole was really good and the sauce was nice.\n\n\n\nAragosta Fra Diavolo – maine lobster, tagliolini, garlic, chili peppers, italian parsely, tomato sauce.\n\n\n\n\n\nOur waiter is removing the bones and plating the fish. The fish and sauce was very good.\n\n\n\n\n\nSogliola Alla Mugnaia – sauteed dover sole, steamed potatoes, lemon-parsley brown butter emulsion.\n\n\nDessert: Becky liked her chestnut cream cappuccino. I only ate about half of the apricot tart, just too many apricots for my tastes.\n\n\n\nChestnut cream cappuccino, meringue, white chocolate foam\n\n\n\n\n\nCrispy apricot tart, pistachio cream.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe show tonight was called “Broadway in Concert”.

    "text": "Santa Barbara, Friday, September 27, 2024\nThis morning when we woke, the Regatta was stationed about one mile off shore from the city of Santa Barbara. Kind of weird that our first port is only about 30 miles from home. The weather today was overcast most of the day with a high around 70F and light winds. After my morning shower, I took my laptop to Horizon lounge to do some work and drink coffee. About an hour later I joined Becky for another coffee and breakfast.\n\n\n\nSelf Service coffee station in Horizon lounge, opens at 630am. I usually order an americano and I think these machines make the best coffee on the ship.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaristas is the coffee shop just outside the main dining room. I usually order an americano here, but the flavor is a bit bitter. Becky likes to get the flavored lattes.\n\n\n\n\n\nSelf service morning snacks next to the coffee bar. I usually don’t have any of these. Becky likes the almond pastries.\n\n\nFor breakfast, I had the special of the day which was huevos rancheros. Becky had an omelet with two lamb chops. After breakfast we tried our skills at the golf putting challenge and the bean bag toss. Then we took the tender to town.\nI can’t remember the last time that we went to Santa Barbara, maybe 15 years ago. We drive through on the freeway about twice a year. The tender to the marina took about 15 minutes to go from ship to shore in one of the ship’s lifeboats. We had planned to visit a brewery and I looked up the opening times before we left. When we got there it was closed and didn’t look like it would open before noon. So we walked along State Street a bit to REI and went in to have a look at the clothes and camping equipment. Back onboard we went to the spa to soak in the big hot tub. Today we skipped lunch.\n\n\n\nWe attended afternoon tea. Oceania puts on a nice tea at 4pm almost every day.\n\n\nCanapes are delivered almost every day. We can choose from a variety of options, which we select on a small order sheet that we place on our door in the morning.\n\n\n\nCalifornia rolls (vegetable maki, ginger pickles, wasabi and tamari sauce)\n\n\n\n\n\nBouquet of crudites (assortment of vegetables sticks with plant based mayo dip)\n\n\nDinner tonight was at a specialty restaurant called Polo Grill, which is a steakhouse.\n\n\n\nApple Cider Marinated, Slow-Roasted Pork Belly with Honey Soy Sauce – this was OK, but not the best I’ve had.\n\n\n\n\n\nRoasted Beetroot and Garlic Goat Cheese, Napoleon with Champagne and Truffle Vinaigrette – Becky liked this.\n\n\n\n\n\nSouthwestern Navy Bean Soup with Pepper Purée, Spanish Chorizo and Sourdough Croutons – very good\n\n\n\n\n\nRibeye (12 oz) – Too big, I only ate half of it.\n\n\n\n\n\nGrilled Colorado Rack of Lamb (12 oz) – Becky liked her lamb, but she had to send one back to the kitchen because it was too rare.\n\n\nWe ordered various side dishes: Lobster Mac & Cheese, Potatoes Au Gratin, Crispy Onion Rings and Haricots Verts Amandine (green beans)\nI chose the Crème Brûlée for dessert. This was OK, not the best I’ve had, I would order it again. None of the other selections sounded good. My second choice would have been ice cream.\n\n\n\nCrème Brûlée\n\n\n\n\n\nBecky’s dessert choice: Chocolate Fudge Brownie with Raspberry Sauce and Tahitian Vanilla Bean Ice Cream\n\n\n\n\n\nThese are the flowers that normally are in each room and they were delivered in the afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Starlink satellite antennas are a new addition to the ship. These are the 12 square flat things mounted on the poles.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe basic internet included with the cruise fare. The internet speed is very slow: 1.4 MB down and 2.5 MB up, which is slightly better than no internet. Pictures take awhile to upload."

    "text": "San Francisco, Sunday, September 29, 2024\nAt 630am I went up to the Horizon Lounge to have my usual morning coffee and about 50 people were there waiting for the ship to sail under the Golden Gate Bridge. As we sailed under the bridge, it was too dark to take pictures.\n\n\n\nThe weather this morning was cloudy and cold.\n\n\nWe had breakfast in the Grand Dining Room. Becky had an omelet and steak. She gave me half of the steak. The steak was not that tender, but had a nice flavor. Becky thought she needed extra calories for our walk today. I ordered scrambled eggs, hash browns and Canadian bacon. After breakfast we played golf.\nAround 10am we left the ship for our walk in the city. The plan for the day was to visit the San Francisco Maritime National Historical Park. The walk was about 1 mile in each direction. The theme for the park is maritime history. The Park includes several historic ships, only the Balcultha was open for self guided tours. Balclutha was a cargo ship, one of thousands of iron and steel sailing vessels built in Great Britain and Europe beginning in the 1860s. During thirteen years under the British flag, Balclutha called at San Francisco five times, bringing coal and general cargo from Europe and returning with California grain. From 1903 to 1930 the ship made yearly voyages between San Francisco and Alaska. Renamed Star of Alaska, she sailed for the Alaska Packers Association, carrying men and supplies to the canneries and bringing back packed salmon.\n\n\n\nThe Balclutha\n\n\n\n\n\nGalley\n\n\n\n\n\nMain deck\n\n\nWe were back onboard in time for lunch. Only the buffet and Waves Grill were open and we decided to eat at Waves Grill, where we could sit down and order off the menu. I had a beer and the Cuban Sandwich and Becky had the Ribs, which was only one rib.\n\n\n\nSlow roasted pork ribs (barbecue sauce, coleslaw) Becky didn’t like the ribs, the meat was too tough and didn’t fall off the bone.\n\n\n\n\n\nOceania Cuban (slow-roasted marinated pork, ham, swiss, dill pickles, mustard, grilled cuban bread, mariquita chips, cuban mojo sauce). A year ago, I thought the Cuban was delicious and during that cruise, I had three of them. This time, I didn’t think they were as good as I remembered.\n\n\nIn the afternoon, I worked on the Art Scavenger Hunt. We have met several people who are also looking for art and we compare and share answers. This is a good way to meet people. While wandering around the ship, I noticed that about ten tables in the main dining room were set up for a birthday dinner. Becky has read many of the posts on Cruise Critic made by the birthday girl. She is very well connected in the travel industry and we figured she was a travel agent. We didn’t know what birthday she was celebrating, but she did say online that it was a special birthday. From the table decorations we learned that she is 90 years old. We saw her around the ship and we were guessing her age was 70.\n\n\n\nBirthday party table.\n\n\nToday’s afternoon tea setup.\n\n\n\nFood cart\n\n\n\n\n\nTea\n\n\nTonight’s dinner was in the Grand Dining Room. Becky had Shrimp Scampi, which she liked. I had Beef Wellington, which was good. I ordered it medium well, since last year when I ordered it medium, it was too rare. I think what the kitchen does is cook a slice a bit more to order from the bottom side. When I turned the meat over, the bottom side was brown, so overall it was cooked as ordered.\n\n\n\nShrimp Scampi\n\n\n\n\n\nBeef Wellington"

    "text": "San Francisco, Monday, September 30, 2024\nThe weather in San Francisco today was mostly sunny and warm. After morning coffee and breakfast we played golf and bean bag toss for points. We don’t know how many points we need to collect for Becky to get a jacket. The cruise staff will publish the redemption values for the prizes tomorrow. The amount of points needed for each item varies by the length of the cruise.\n\n\n\nWe ordered room service for lunch. Shrimp cocktail, vegetable California rolls, chicken Caesar salad, Tuscan kale salad and a Club sandwich.\n\n\nOur shore excursion started at 1pm and lasted until 5pm. The tour was called “Views Of San Francisco” and included three stops and a narrated drive through the city.\n\n\n\nThe first top was at the Gold Gate Park. Opened in 1937, the bridge is considered one of the seven engineering wonders of the United States.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe second stop was at the Sutro Baths, a massive swimming facility built at the ocean’s edge in 1894. In its heyday, the glamorous baths could accommodate 10,000 people.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe third stop was at Twin Peaks, where we saw views of the city and bay.\n\n\nThe tour was OK, not something we would have normally signed up for. The cruise fare included a $300 per person shore excursion credit, which we paid for since in the past we could opt out and the fare would be reduced by $300 per person. Today’s tour was $99 per person. I think we could have taken an Uber to the locations, then we would have been on our own schedule. We would have preferred to spend more time at Sutro Baths and less time at Gold Gate Park. Most tour stops were about 30 minutes. The narration given by the tour guide was good.\n\n\n\nThe Regatta departed San Francisco about 530pm. As we left the city, the wind was blowing and Becky wanted me to pretend I was a dog with my head out the window of a car. Alcatraz was in view.\n\n\n\n\n\nAs we sailed out of the bay we got a nice view of the Golden Gate Bridge.\n\n\nWe ordered dinner from Polo Grill to be served in our cabin, which was served course by course. I had a crab cake and a pork chop and Becky had shrimp and more shrimp. Dessert was key Lime Pie.\n\n\n\nShrimp and crab cake\n\n\n\n\n\nShrimp and pork chop\n\n\n\n\n\nKey lime pie"

Becky wanted to get a jacket, but they didn’t have her size and the next size up was too big. Her second choice was a shirt, hat and socks. One of the other passengers gave her about 25 points, so we will take the point cards home and use them on our next Oceania cruise in November of 2025.\n\n\n\nIn the afternoon we attended tea.\n\n\nWe ordered some drinks from the bar to take back to our room to have with our canapes\n\n\n\nBasket of crispy corn tortilla chips with Mexican salsa cruda.

    "text": "Ensenada, Mexico, Wednesday, October 2, 2024\nThe weather in the was overcast with a marine layer that was expected to burn off mid morning, and the high temperature was 80F with an 8 mph wind. We had breakfast in the main dining room.\nOur tour group met on the pier at 10am for a tour called “VIP Wine Tasting With Gourmet Lunch”. The cost of the tour was $179 per person. Not a tour we would have chosen, but we needed to use up as much of the $300 per person non-refundable shore credit as possible without going over by too much. So in the end, we went under by $44. Being forced to take tours has not been popular with the Oceania customers, and as of October 1st, they have dropped this “benefit” along with the wine and beer by the glass at lunch and dinner. Now the complaints online are about the cruise line dropping the benefits and raising the prices. For our next cruise on Oceania, scheduled for November 2025, will be grandfathered under the old program and get the shore excursion credit and wine and beer at lunch and dinner.\n\n\n\nVines of Finca Tre.\n\n\nThe bus ride out to the winery took 45 minutes and the tour guide provided some narration to kill the time. When we got off the bus, it was hot. Down in the cellar it was much cooler. We were given two small samples of wine to taste. The first one was a rose and the second was a red blend. I thought both were OK, but the samples were too small. Next we went upstairs to a large covered patio with nice views of the vineyards. Since the patio was open air, it was hot and any breezes that did come by no matter how small were most welcomed but insufficient to cool us off.\n\n\n\nPouring the wine samples.\n\n\n\n\n\nPatio where lunch was served\n\n\nThe lunch was served in three courses, with the first being raw tuna on vegetables, jalapeños and diced garlic. There was some green sauce made from tomatillos. It took a while to get served our first wine, by which time we had finished the first course. I was expecting some explanation about the paring of the food with the wine, which was the same rose we sampled before. The amount poured was pitiful and after our food was long finished. Becky didn’t like her food, so I ate it. Only later, when we were back on the bus did we learn that the fish was tuna. The second course was some small lettuce leaves piled on some beef, which was good, but the wine didn’t come out until much later. And by much later, I mean like 20 minutes later. The waiters skipped our table and after seeing them on their phones back by the bar, I walked over to our tour guide and asked him to get our table served. A third small sample of wine was poured, a Shiraz, and not connected to any food. Dessert was a scoop of vanilla ice cream on a cookie, served in a glass cup. Over the top was poured some coffee with Kahlua and Baileys. The dessert reminded me of an affogato. Back on the bus, the tour guide asked the group if they liked the wines and food. He got silence from the group.\nWe sat at a table for four with a father and son from Los Angeles and we had fun talking to them. The dad was not shy about expressing his disappointment with the wine and service. As we were boarding the bus I told the tour guide in private that I had some constructive feedback for him. He thanked me and said that on the bus we would be filling out a comment sheet. When the shore excursion desk opened later in the afternoon, I went to offer my feedback. That evening I received a letter from the shore excursion desk saying that they would look into the matter. Since it was the last day of the cruise, there was not much that could be done.\n\n\n\nTwo of the wines we tasted. The red blend was $29 per bottle.\n\n\nWe were back on the ship by 2pm and we went to the spa to sit in the hot tub. We didn’t stay too long. At 4pm we attended tea for the last time.\nWe went to Martini’s bar for happy hour (two for one, $14). We need to spend the last of our onboard credit. We had a conversation with a couple from Maui and later we had dinner with them in the main dining room.\n\n\n\nWe ordered a drink called, Insignis – E11even vodka, peach schnapps, orange juice, lemon juice, caramel syrup, vanilla syrup. Very good.\n\n\nBack at the room, we finished packing and set out our large suitcase. By 10pm most of the suitcases had been picked up so I had to take mine down the hallway to where the luggage was being collected."
